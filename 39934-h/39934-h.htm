<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">Our</span> nursery legends and popular superstitions are fast becoming
matters of history, except in the more remote and secluded portions
of the country. The age of the steam engine, and the electric battery,
and the many other practical adaptations of the triumphs of physical
science, is apparently not the one in which such "waifs and strays"
from the mythical lore of the dim and distant Past are very likely to
be much sought after or honoured. But now that the light of
modern investigation, and especially that ray furnished by recent
discoveries in philological science, has been directed towards their
deeper and more hidden mysteries, profound philosophical historians
have begun to discover that from this apparently desolate literary
region much reliable knowledge may be extracted, leading to conclusions
of the most interesting and important kind, with reference
to the early history of our race. The labours of the brothers Grimm,
Dr. Adalbert Kuhn, Professor Max M&uuml;ller, the Rev. G. W. Cox, and
others, have recently received considerable attention from philosophic
enquirers into the origin and early development of the people
from whom nearly all of the European, and some of the Asiatic,
modern nationalities have sprung.</p>

<p>It is found that many of these imperfect, and sometimes grotesque,
traditions, legends, and superstitions are, in reality, not the "despicable
rubbish" which the "learned" have been in the habit of
regarding them, but rather the crude ore, which, when skilfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
smelted down, yields, abundantly, pure metal well worthy of the
literary hammer of the most profound student in general history,
ethnology, or the phenomena attendant upon psychological development.</p>

<p>Professor Henry Morley, in the chapter on Ethnology, in his
"English Writers," after noticing "how immediately and easily
particular words, common in their application, would become
available for common use," and "how often <i>images of the seen would
become symbols of the unseen</i>," truly says, "The world about us is not
simply mirrored, but <i>informed with a true soul</i>, by all the tongues that
syllable man's knowledge and his wants. The subtlest harmonies of
life and nature may lie hidden in the very letters of the alphabet."</p>

<p>The subject has been but recently introduced, in a thoroughly
popular form, to the English reader. Dasent's "Popular Tales from
the Norse," and occasional papers by local writers, intensified and
extended the interest taken in this species of research. The publication,
in 1863, by Mr. Walter K. Kelly, of his "Curiosities of Indo-European
Tradition and Folk-Lore," however, may be said to have
given a still greater impetus to popular investigation in this direction.
This is largely to be attributed to the fact that he has summarised
in a very pleasing manner much of the abstruse learning
of the German philologists and mythologists to whom reference has
already been made.</p>

<p>Whilst contemplating the publication of some "Supplementary
Notes to the History of Preston and its Environs," the early chapters
of which, of course, would necessarily deal with what is termed
the "pre-historic period," Mr. Kelly's work came into my hands.
I was induced to considerably enlarge my plan, in consequence
of the value I immediately placed upon its contents, and of the
suggestion in the following paragraph, which appears in its preface:</p>

<p>"In not a few instances I have been able to illustrate Dr. Kuhn's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
principles by examples of the folk-lore of Great Britain and Ireland,
and would gladly have done so more copiously had matter for the
purpose been more accessible. My efforts in that direction have
made me painfully aware how much we are behind the Germans, not
only as to our insight into the meaning of such relics of the past, but
also as to our industry in collecting them. The latter defect is indeed
a natural consequence of the former, and it is to be hoped that our
local arch&aelig;ologists will no longer be content to labour under either of
them when once they have found what far-reaching knowledge may
be extracted out of old wives' tales and notions. Only four years ago
the editor of 'Notes and Queries' spoke hypothetically (in the
preface to 'Choice Notes') of a time to come when the study of
folk-lore (he was I believe the inventor of that very expressive and
sterling word) should have risen from a pleasant pastime to the rank
of a science. Already his anticipation has been realised, and henceforth
every careful collector of a novel scrap of folk-lore, or of even a
well-marked variety of an old type, may entertain a reasonable hope
that he has in some degree subserved the purposes of the ethnologist
and the philosophical historian."</p>

<p>In 1865-6 I published a series of the "Supplementary Notes" referred
to, in the <i>Preston Guardian</i> newspaper. The general favour with
which they were received, and the increasing interest I felt in the
subject, induced me to continue my researches, with the view to the
ultimate publication of the present volume. The original papers, as
well as other essays afterwards published elsewhere, have not only
been carefully revised, and, in some instances, rearranged, but the
quantity of new matter added in each chapter is such as to render
the work in every respect much more complete, and more worthy of
being regarded as having, in some small degree, "subserved the
purposes of the ethnologist and the philosophical historian." I would
gladly persuade myself that I have, at least, rendered what many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
regard as frivolous, and others as very abstruse and very "dry
reading," interesting, attractive, and instructive to the general reader.
If I succeed in this respect, my chief object will have been accomplished.</p>

<p>The various authorities relied upon or quoted are sufficiently indicated
in the body of the work to render a catalogue of them here
unnecessary. I may add, however, that the principal portions of
the papers contributed by my friend, Mr. T. T. Wilkinson, F.R.A.S.,
to the "Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Historic
Society," have since been incorporated with a portion of the collection
of the late Mr. Jno. Harland, F.S.A., and published in a volume
by F. Warne and Co., entitled "Lancashire Folk Lore."</p>

AND REMAINS OF THEIR MYTHOLOGY AND LOCAL NOMENCLATURE.</small></h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this our life, exempt from public haunt,<br /></span>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">On</span> several occasions, when discussing obscure questions of early
topography or ancient nomenclature, although readily acknowledging
the value of all facts in connection with genuine etymological science,
I have recommended great caution in the use of this powerful but
somewhat capricious arch&aelig;ological ally. I yet retain a strong impression
that this caution is still a necessary condition of truly
scientific historical or antiquarian research. Consequently, several
of the presumed etymologies in the present work are advanced with
diffidence, and with a thorough conviction that some of them may
prove to be illusive. The suggestion of a probability, however, is a
very different thing to dogmatic assertion in such matters, a practice
which cannot be too much condemned.</p>

<p>It is not very many years since the writer of the article "Language,"
in Knight's Cyclop&aelig;dia, felt it his duty, in introducing the subject, to
use the following strong expressions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That division of grammar which is called etymology has been
disgraced by such puerile trifling, and has been pursued with such
an utter disregard to anything like scientific principles, as to create
in the minds of many persons a suspicion against everything presented
to their notice under the name of etymology. Such persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
have viewed etymology as nothing else than a dexterous play upon
words, and have looked upon etymologists as little better than indifferent
punsters. That the generality of writers upon this subject
scarcely deserve any better appellation will hardly be denied by
anyone who has studied etymology on true philological principles;
and, if any doubt were entertained upon the point, it would only be
necessary to refer to such works as Damm's 'Homeric Lexicon,' and
Lennep's 'Etymology of the Greek Language,' which are full of such
wild conjectures and such extravagant etymologies, that we cannot
be surprised that a study which has produced such results should
have been considered ridiculous and absurd."</p>

<p>The writer afterwards refers to the extent, and explains the nature
of the progress which had been made during the twenty or thirty
years previous to the date of his own paper. (1839). He justly
attributes this progress to the "comparison of many languages with
each other;" but he especially insists that "nothing has perhaps
contributed to this improvement more than the discovery of Sanscrit
(for as it has been justly observed, it may properly be called a discovery),
which was found to bear such a striking resemblance both in
its more important words and in its grammatical forms to the Latin
and Greek, the Teutonic and Sclavonic languages, as to lead to the
conclusion that all must have been derived from a common source."</p>

<p>An able writer in the <i>Saturday Review</i> truly describes the science of
comparative philology as "the great discovery of modern scholarship,
the discovery which more than any other unites distant ages
and countries in one tie of brotherhood." Hence its great value to
antiquarian students of every class.</p>

<p>Further investigation has fully demonstrated the truth of the
views thus expressed. Not only is the affinity of the languages now
admitted without dispute, but the consanguinity of the peoples and
the identity of many of their popular traditions and superstitions
have been demonstrated with scientific precision by such writers as
the brothers Grimm, Dr. Kuhn, Dr. Roth, Max M&uuml;ller, Farrer,
Dasent, the Rev. G. W. Cox, and others, who have devoted special
attention to the subject.</p>

<p>This common ancestry is sometimes styled Indo-European; but
the phrase being open to objection, as including more than the precise
facts justify, the term Aryan, or Arian, is now generally preferred.
Some writers regard the Aryans as descendants of Japhet, and the
Semitic tribes as the progeny of Shem. In the latter they include
the Hebrews, the Ph&#339;nicians, the Arabs, and Ethiopians; and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
languages are radically distinct from those of the Aryan family.
The country about the upper Oxus river, now mainly included in the
dominions of the Khan of Bockhara, is generally agreed upon as the
locality from whence the various members of the Aryan family originally
migrated, some northward and westward over Europe, and
others southward and eastward into India. The Kelts, the Teutons,
the Greeks, Latins, Letts, and Sclaves are all European branches of
this original stock. The Persians and the high caste Hindoos are the
principal descendants of the southern and south-eastern migration.
The chief elements of the British population at the present time are
Keltic, represented by the Welsh, Irish, and Gaelic tribes, and the
Teutonic, which includes Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, and Danish and
Norse Scandinavians.</p>

<p>The non-Aryan races inhabiting Europe are not relatively very
extensive or important. The chief are the Magyars and the Turks.
There are besides some Tatars and Ugrians in Russia, a few Basques
in the south-west of France and on the neighbouring Spanish frontier,
and the Laps and Fins in Northern Europe.</p>

<p>The oldest writings extant in the Sanscrit branch of the Aryan
tongue are termed the "Vedas." These works include a collection
of hymns chanted or sung by the earlier south-eastern emigrants.
It is believed this collection was formed about fourteen hundred years
before the birth of Christ. According to ancient Hindoo authority,
these hymns are coeval with creation. It is asserted that Brahma
breathed them from his own mouth, or, in other words, that he
milked them out from fire, air, and the sun. Some traditions state
that they wore scattered abroad or lost; and that a great sage, "Vyasa,
the arranger," collected them together about 5,000 years ago. Vyasa,
who was assisted in his labours by many other sages, taught the
Vedic literature or religion to four distinct pupils. Payla learnt
the Rig Veda, Vais'ampayana the Yajur Veda, Jaimini the Sama
Veda, and Sumantu the Atharvan'a. The three first-mentioned are
named collectively the sacred Trayi, or the Triad. These versions
were afterwards much extended and commented upon by after sages.</p>

<p>The term Veda is derived from the Sanscrit root <i>vid</i>, which signifies
to know. It implies the sum of all knowledge. By another etymology
it is held to imply revealed knowledge, or that species of wisdom
which contains within itself the evidence of its own truth. Rig is
from the root <i>rich</i>, to laud, and implies that the Vedic knowledge is
delivered in the form of hymns of praise.</p>

<p>Max M&uuml;ller regards the Vedas as containing the key note of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
religion, natural as well as revealed. They exhibit a belief in God,
a perception of the difference between good and evil, and a conviction
that the Deity loveth the one and hateth the other. The degenerate
religion of the modern Hindoos, and especially the worship of
Krishnah, is described by a recent writer, as (in comparison with
that of the Vedas) "a moral plague, the ravages of which are as
appalling as they are astounding."</p>

<p>Walter Kelly says:&mdash;"The Sanscrit tongue, in which the Vedas
are written, is the sacred language of India; that is to say, the oldest
language, the one which was spoken, as the Hindoos believe, by the
gods themselves, when gods and men were in frequent fellowship
with each other, from the time when Yama descended from heaven
to become the first of mortals. This ancient tongue may not be the
very one which was spoken by the common ancestors of Hindoos and
Europeans, but at least it is its nearest and purest derivative; nor is
there any reason to believe that it is removed from it by more than a
few degrees. Hence the supreme importance of the Sanscrit vocabulary
and literature as a key to the languages and supernatural
lore of ancient and modern Europe."</p>

<p>This discovery of the Sanscrit writings, and especially of the Vedas,
has already exercised considerable influence upon etymological science.
Before its introduction the main element in such inquiries consisted
in the tracing <i>backwards</i> words corrupted or obscure in modern English
to their original roots in Keltic, Teutonic, Greek, or Latin. The Sanscrit,
however, being a <i>written</i> form of one of the earliest of the varieties
of these cognate tongues, gives the etymological student the advantage
of a flank or rear position, by means of which he may sometimes
decipher the meaning of a doubtful term, by the inverse or <i>ascending</i>
process, and thus gain some knowledge of its original meaning,
perhaps long since lost by the descendants of those who first introduced
it into the ancient language of Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is by no means improbable that the idle historical legends related
by Nennius and Geoffrey of Monmouth, respecting the arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of Brutus and his Trojan followers in Britain, after the destruction
of Priam's imperial city by the allied Greeks, may have just so much
foundation in fact as might be furnished by a time-honoured tradition
respecting the eastern home from which our remote ancestors
originally migrated. The natives of Britain, on first coming in contact
with the early merchants and traders from the Mediterranean
shores, would doubtless hear something of the Iliad and the &AElig;neid,
with the heroes of which they might innocently confound their own
remote and vaguely conceived demi-deities or warlike human ancestry.
Notwithstanding the just contempt in which these legends are
held by modern historians, there still exists a kind of instinctive faith
that a very remote tradition, however much it may have been overlaid
and disfigured by relatively modern inventions, lies at the base
of the main story. Emigrants from Iberia (situated between the
Caspian and the Euxine Seas) are said to have settled in Greece (the
Pelasgi), and in Tuscany and Spain (the Iberians). In Laurent's
"Ancient Geography" is the following passage:&mdash;"In the Caucasus
were found the Bruchi, the modern Burtani or Britani, a free tribe,
rich in silver and gold." It is not improbable that the advent of
emigrants of this tribe in England may underlie the legend of the
Trojan Brutus and his followers. Eastern Albania too may have
contributed, along with its neighbours, to the migratory hordes which
passed to the west. The earliest name by which Britain was known to
the Greeks and Romans is Albion. The Gaels of Scotland still
speak of the island as Albin. In Merlin's famous prophecy, in
Geoffrey of Monmouth's British History, the country is frequently
named Albania. The universal tradition of the North German and
Scandinavian tribes is that they came from the neighbourhood of the
Caucasus to the North West of Europe. An early Odin is said to
have introduced from the east the worship of the sun. Another at
the head of the &AElig;sir warriors imported the Runic alphabet. He is
styled Mid Othin. Two other chiefs of this name figure in their
legendary history.</p>

<p>Dr. Leigh held the opinion that the Brigantes, and especially the
Setantii, or the Lancashire portion of the then population, were a
mixed race, consisting of Kelts, Ph&#339;nicians, and Armenians. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
only reason for this conjecture appears to have been based on the
fact that one of the chief rivers was named Belisama, which, he
says, "in the Ph&#339;nician language, signifies the Moon or the Goddess
of Heaven," and that Ribel, now the name of the same river,
in the Armenian tongue signifies Heaven. Mr. Thornber says
"Belisama means Queen of Heaven, and that the Romans paid
divine honours to the Ribble under the title of Minerva Belisama."
This conjecture apparently rests on the statement of Leigh, and the
fact that the Roman temple at Ribchester was dedicated to Minerva.
There appears to be, however, some error here respecting the sex of
Bel. The Ph&#339;nician "Queen of Heaven," or "Queen of the
Stars," was named Astroarche or Astarte. She is supposed by some
to be identical with the Greek Juno, or Selene (the moon), by others
she is regarded as the planet Venus. The Armenians were a branch
of the Aryan family, and the Ph&#339;nicians, as I have before said, were
of the Semitic stock.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Sanchuniathon, the ancient Ph&#339;nician historian,
says that the Ph&#339;nicians worshipped the sun as "the only
lord of heaven," under the name Beelsamen, which was equivalent to
the Greek Zeus or the Latin Jupiter. Baal is formed from a root
which signifies, and is literally equivalent to, lord or owner. A
Maltese inscription "Malkereth Baal Tsor," is interpreted "King of
the city, Lord of Tyre." In the Septuagint Baal is called Hercules;
in the Ph&#339;nician language Orcul, light of all. One writer adds "Baal
was Saturn; others have considered Baal to be the planet Jupiter.
A supreme idol might easily be compared with those of other nations;
hence arose this variety of opinions."</p>

<p>Amongst the many conjectures as to the origin of Stonehenge is
one put forth by Godfrey Higgins, that it was built by Druids, "the
priests of Oriental colonies, who emigrated from India." Mr. Davis,
the author of "Celtic Researches," refers to a passage in Diodorus
Siculus, in which it is stated, on the authority of Hecat&aelig;us, that a
round temple existed in Britain dedicated to Apollo. Mr. Davis conjectures
that Stonehenge is the edifice referred to.</p>

<p>The late Rev. John Williams, Archdeacon of Cardigan, in "Essays,"
published in 1858, strongly advocates the "Hyperborean theory,"
founded on the passage in Diodorus referred to. This view of the
case implies that the Hyperboreans migrated mainly by water from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Central Asia, not long after the days of Noah; that they eventually
occupied Great Britain, Spain, and Gaul, west of the Alps; that the
Druid priests of Stonehenge were in sympathy and constant communication
with those of Delphi; that they were civilised to a large
extent, and were intimately related by blood with the Pelasgians of
Ancient Greece.</p>

<p>The ancient name of this remarkable relic of the past is unfortunately
lost, "Stonehenge" being evidently of Saxon origin, and in
no way connected with its architects; the tale told by Nennius, about
the murder of four hundred and sixty British nobles, through the
treachery of Hengist, being a later romance invented to account for
its Saxon name, Stanhengist. W. G. Palgrave, in his "Central and
Eastern Arabia," describes the ruins of a "structure" which so nearly
resembles the famous Wiltshire relic, that he calls it an "Arabian
Stonehenge." He adds that the natives spoke of a similar ancient
edifice as still existing in a part of the country which he did not visit.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock in his "Pre-historic Times," after alluding to
the mythical character of the expedition to Ireland of Aurelius Ambrosius
and Merlin, as related by Geoffrey of Monmouth, in search of
the sacred materials employed in the erection of the megalithic edifice,
says the larger stones are evidently similar in lithological character
to the immense numbers yet strewn over Salisbury plain, and locally
termed "Sarcens." He adds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stonehenge is generally considered to mean the hanging stones,
as indeed was long ago suggested by Wace, an Anglo-Norman poet,
who says:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stanhengues ont mom Englois<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pieres pandues en Francois,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">but it is surely more natural to derive the last syllable from the
Anglo-Saxon word 'ing,' a field; as we have Keston, originally
Kyst-staning, the field of stone coffins. What more natural than that
a new race, finding this magnificent ruin, standing in solitary grandeur
on Salisbury Plain, and able to learn nothing of its origin,
should call it simply the <i>place of stones</i>? What more unnatural than
that they should do so, if they knew the name of him in whose honour
it was erected?"</p>

<p>After disposing of some other arguments in favour of a post-Roman
date for the edifice, and expressing his conviction that this structure
and its kindred one at Abury were used as temples for worship, Sir
John Lubbock says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stonehenge may then I think be regarded as a monument of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Bronze Age, though apparently it was not all erected at one time,
the inner circle of small unwrought blue stones being probably older
than the rest; as regards Abury, since the stones are all in their
natural condition, while those of Stonehenge are roughly hewn, it
seems reasonable to conclude that Abury is the older of the two, and
belongs either to the close of the Stone Age, or to the commencement
of that of Bronze."</p>

<p>Some writers regard the British or Keltic god Bel or Beil as not
immediately the Belus or Baal of the Asiatic nations, but that it
"designates <i>an exalted luminous deity</i>, peculiar to the Celts." This is
the view of Jacob Grimm, and it is endorsed by W. K. Kelly.
Another writer thinks that "the general character of Asiatic idolatry
renders it likely that Baal meant originally the true lord of the
universe, <i>and that his worship degenerated</i> into the worship of a powerful
body in the material world."</p>

<p>The origin of the not yet entirely exploded superstition respecting
the "divine right of kings" may have something to do with this prim&aelig;val
sun or fire worship. The Anglo-Saxon princes claimed descent
from Odin or Woden, who, as will afterwards be shown, is evidently
the Teutonic representative of the Aryan Indra, or the luminous or
lightning-god. A recent writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Every king of Egypt considered himself a direct descendant of the
sun, and over his name was 'Son of the Sun;' and as the sun was
Phr&egrave;, so each king was called Phr&egrave;. As in the East at the present
time, the Ottoman Emperor is termed by the Arabs, 'Sooltan ebn
Sooltan'&mdash;Emperor son of an Emperor. The king considered that
his authority and the virtues and powers of his rule were direct
emanations from the solar disc. This idea is beautifully set forth in
a device from a tomb in the cemetery of El Emarna, where may be
observed Ammophis, with his queen and their children, standing at a
window or gallery of their palace, and are all engaged in throwing to
their subjects, who are standing below with hands upraised to receive
them, collars of distinction, vases, rings of money, symbols of life,
and other blessings. These gifts the disc of the sun, which is represented
above, is in the act of bestowing upon them. The king and
his family were the only media of communication between the sun,
the source of all blessings, and the people. This is significantly set
forth by the rays which projected life into their mouths, and infused
into their hearts courage, wisdom, and justice."</p>

<p>Frances Power Cobbe, in her "Cities of the Past," after visiting
the ruins of Baalbec, quotes several beautiful passages from Du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Perron's <i>Zend Avesta</i>, illustrative of the purity of the sentiment of the
earlier fire-worshippers. She says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In what degree this high Persian faith (still existing in no ignoble
type among the Parsees of India) was connected with the sun-worship
of the gross Ph&#339;nician mythology, it is hard to conjecture. Perhaps
there was no relation at all, and Baal (or Bel), the sun-god, never
received in his impure fanes the homage of a true worshipper of
Ormusd, the supremely wise Lord, of whom the <i>Zend Avesta</i> only tells
us his light is hidden under all that shines. At least the faith of which
Heliogabalus was hierophant had fallen as low as ever the religious
sentiment of human nature may be debased. Yet does the 'golden
star,' Zoroaster, throw a mysterious halo over the fire worship of
East and West; that faith which blazed out in the Bactrian plains
before the dawn of history, and which lights yet its memorial fires
each midsummer eve in the vales of the Christian Scotland and Ireland."</p>

<p>She might have added, at least until very recently, the hills and
dales of Lancashire and some other parts of England.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that before the corruption referred to took
place, the Keltic emigrants to this country may have arrived at their
western home, and so have introduced the worship of Baal or Bel in
something like its pristine purity; and hence the distinction between
the famous deity of Heliopolis and his presumed representative in
Britain. A semi-subterranean temple, dedicated to the worship of
Mithras, the Persian Sun or Apollo, was discovered in 1822 at Housesteads,
Northumberland (Borcovicus), on the line of the great Roman
wall. Mr. Hodgson describes it in detail in a contribution to the
Arch. &AElig;L. O.S., vol. 1. This worship appears to have belonged to the
debased form referred to. It evoked edicts from several Roman emperors
decreeing its suppression, but without avail. This cruel and degrading
superstition was, however, not introduced into the western
portion of the "old world," until shortly before the advent of
Christ. An altar, dedicated to this deity, found in the cave temple
at Housesteads, was erected A.D. 253. Remains of Mithraic worship
have been found at York and Chester, and other places, including
Chesterholm (Vindolana), and Rutchester (Vindobala), on the line
of the great Roman wall. This worship of Mithras is evidently
but a corrupt descendant from the ancient Aryan adoration of Mithra,
the god of daylight.</p>

<p>From these and other reasons, yet to be advanced, I am inclined to
regard the introduction of the British god Bel or Beil as appertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to a much earlier epoch in our history than the advent of the Ph&#339;nician
merchants, who, most probably, did visit the Belisama, Portus
Setantiorum, and other harbours on the Lancashire and Cheshire
coast, for trading purposes, but at a relatively much more recent
period.</p>

<p>Mr. John Baldwin, in his "Pre-historic Nations," contends that
the "Bronze Age in Western Europe was introduced by a foreign
people of the Cushite race, culture, and religion, and that for a very
long period it was controlled and directed by their influence." He
further adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The first settlements of the Arabian Cushites in Spain and
Northern Africa cannot have been later than 5,000 years before the
Christian era.... Probably the Cushite race, religion, and
civilisation first went to the ancient Finnic people of Britain, Gaul,
and the Scandinavian countries from Spain and Africa. The beginning
of the Bronze Age in these countries was much older than the
period of Tyre. The Tyrian establishments in those western countries
seem to have been later than the Aryan immigration that created
the Keltic peoples and languages; and it may be that the Tyrians
introduced the 'Age of Iron' not long after their arrival, for it was
evidently much older than the time of the Romans."</p>

<p>Professor Nilsson refers the ancient bronze instruments, etc., to
Ph&#339;nician influence, and describes some sculpture on two stones on
a tumulus near Kivik, which, Mr. Baldwin observes, "even Sir John
Lubbock admits, 'may fairly be said to have a Ph&#339;nician or
Egyptian appearance.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin traces to Arabian Cushite colonies the very ancient
civilisation of Egypt, Caldea, and the southern portion of India, as
well as Ph&#339;nicia and the western nations. Another stone, described
by Professor Nilsson, is an obelisk symbolising Baal. Referring to
this monument, Mr. Baldwin says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The festival of Baal or Balder, celebrated on midsummer night in
the upper part of Norway, reveals the Cushite race, for the midnight
fire in presence of the midnight sun did not originate in that latitude.
This festival of Baal was celebrated in the British Islands until recent
times. Baal has given such names as Baltic, Great and Little Belt,
Belteburga, Baleshangen, and the like." He asks, "What other
people could have brought the worship of Baal to Western Europe in
pre-historic times? We see them in the stone circles, in the ruins at
Abury and Stonehenge, in the festival of Baal that lingered until our
own times; and there is something for consideration in the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Arabia has still the ruins of ancient structures precisely like Stonehenge.
It is probable that the Arabians, or their representatives in
Spain and North Africa, went northward and began the Age of Bronze
more than 2,000 years before Gades [Cadiz] was built."</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin draws a marked distinction between the modern
Mohammedan Semitic population of Arabia and their great Cushite,
Hamite, or Ethiopian predecessors. The former, he says, "are
comparatively modern in Arabia," they have "appropriated the
reputation of the old race," and have unduly occupied the chief
attention of modern scholars.</p>

<p>Dr. Hooker, at the meeting of the British Association in 1868,
described a race of men in a district of Eastern Bengal, who erect, at
the present day, monuments similar to those termed, in Western
Europe, Druidical. With his own eyes he had seen "dolmens" and
"cromlechs" not six months old. He says that they call a stone by
the same name as is given to it in the Keltic idioms of Wales and
Brittany, though, he adds, little of the character of their language is
yet known.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock, referring to the very ancient stone weapons
found in Denmark, Switzerland, France, England, and other
countries, termed <i>pal&aelig;oliths</i>, says:&mdash;"Some implements of the same
type have been found in Spain, in Assyria, and in India. The
latter have been described by Mr. Bruce Foote; they were found in
the Madras and North Arcot districts, and are of quartzite, and in
several cases were found by Messrs. Foote and King, <i>in situ</i>, at depths
of from three to ten feet. The specimens figured will show how
closely they resemble our European specimens, and it is interesting
that in the words of Mr. Foote, 'the area, over which the lateritic
formations were spread, has undergone, as already stated, great
changes since their deposition. A great part of the formation has
been removed by denudation, and deep valleys cut into them are
now occupied by the alluvium of various rivers.'"</p>

<p>In several parts of Britain, and especially in Cumberland, altars
have been found dedicated by Roman legionaries or their auxiliaries
to a god named Belatucadrus. Mr. Thomas Wright (Celt, Roman,
and Saxon, p. 292), after referring to a small one erected at Ellanborough
by Julius Civilis, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Several others dedicated to this deity have been found at Netherby,
Castlesteads, Burgh-on-the-sands, Bankshead, and other places.
In some instances, as in an altar found at Drumburgh, the deity is
addressed by the epithet, <span class="smcapl">DEO SANCTO BELATVCADRO</span>. In some altars he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is identified with Mars, as on one found at Plumpton Wall, dedicated
<span class="smcapl">DEO MARTI BELATVCADRI ET NVMINIB AVGG</span>. Several attempts have been
made to derive the name from Hebrew, Welsh, or Irish, and it has
been hastily taken for granted that this god was identical with the
Ph&#339;nician Baal. Altars to Belatucadrus have been found at Kirkby
Thore, at Welp Castle, and at Brougham, in Westmorland. The one
at Brougham was dedicated by a man named Andagus, which sounds
like a Teutonic name."</p>

<p>Since the preceding paragraphs were written, I have seen in the
Manchester Natural History Museum, a rude altar dedicated to this
god, which, I am informed, was found some years ago at Ribchester,
on the Ribble. As I had not previously seen or heard of it, it is not
mentioned in my published "History of Preston and its Environs."
The inscription is somewhat defaced, but the <span class="smcapl">DEO MARTI BELATVCADRI</span>
is very distinct. It appears, like the one found at Plumpton Wall, to
have been dedicated to this god, and to the gods of the emperor
(<span class="smcapl">NVMINIB AVGG</span>), or, as some think, to the reigning emperor himself.
The dedicator is Julius Augustalis, the prefect of some military corps,
the name of which I cannot, at present, satisfactorily decipher.</p>

<p>The compounding of the name of <i>Baal</i> or <i>Bel</i> with other words is
common, as in the ancient name of the Ribble&mdash;<i>Belisama</i>. This
<i>Belatucadrus</i> appears to belong to this class, at least so far as <i>cadrus</i>
is concerned, for at Risingham, in Northumberland, an altar was
found dedicated to <span class="smcapl">MOGONT CAD</span>, which may perhaps mean, when
written in full, in the nominative case, <span class="smcapl">MOGONTIS CADRUS</span>. Horsley
imagined it probable that the <span class="smcapl">CAD</span> had reference to the <i>Gadeni</i>, a
Caledonian tribe; but Mr. Wright regards this as very doubtful.
The Welsh word <i>cad</i> means war, battle, tumult, etc. May not <span class="smcapl">Cadrus</span>,
therefore, be a Keltic synonym for Mars?</p>

<p>Other altars have been found dedicated to gods that may probably
be traced to an Eastern origin. One found at Birrens, in Scotland,
exhibits a winged deity, holding a spear in her right hand and a globe
in her left. The dedication is to the goddess <i>Brigantia</i>. Mr. Wright
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was supposed this was the deity of the Brigantes, but I am not
aware that this country was ever called <i>Brigantia</i>, and it is not probable
the conqueror would worship the deity of a vanquished tribe.
I feel more inclined to think the name was taken from <i>Brigantium</i>, in
Switzerland, a town which occupied the site of the modern Bregentz.
An altar found at Chester was dedicated <span class="smcapl">DEAE NYMPHAE BRIG</span>, which
in this case would be 'To the Nymph Goddess of Brigantium.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Another ancient city styled Brigantium, now Brian&ccedil;on, was situated
on an opposite spur of the Alps, in the country of the Taurini,
now Piedmont. Ancient geographers speak of a tribe of Thracians,
who were styled Briges. In Laurent's work, the river
at present named the Barrow, in Ireland, is termed the Birgus.
A people on the eastern coast of Ireland were called Brigantes,
and the name Brigantina is still retained in the province of Gallicia,
in Spain. Some authorities contend that the Gaedhels or Gaels, the
Gaelic or Erse element of our population, originally entered Ireland
and the south-west of England from Spain. From Ireland they
spread, northward, to the western isles and highlands of Scotland,
and westward, to the Isle of Man and the North of England and
Wales. In one of the preserved extracts from the lost book of Drom
Sneachta, supposed to have been written before the advent of St.
Patrick, is what is termed "the Prime Story of Irruption and Migration."
From this we learn that the ancient Milesian inhabitants
themselves had traditions respecting their advent from Spain, which
referred to the prior occupation of the country by two other
branches of the Gaelic race, viz., the Firbolgs and the Tuatha d&eacute;
Dannan. The story says the Milesians left Scythia for Egypt, but
returned, and afterwards migrated to Spain by way of Greece.
After a long residence in the peninsula, they built the city of
Bragantia. About 1700 B.C., a colony of them landed at the mouth
of the Slaney, in Wexford, under the command of the eight sons
of Milesias or Galamah. In two battles they defeated their predecessors,
and divided the country amongst themselves. The
Cymri, another branch of the Keltic stock, on the contrary, entered
Britain from Gaul, and were, eventually, to a considerable extent,
driven upon the Gaelic tribes in the West of England and Wales
by the pressure of their Teutonic successors. Professor H. Morley says
that that portion of the population "in the North of England, who
battled against the gradual progress of expulsion," was "known as
Briganted, fighting thieves. Brigant is Welsh for thief and highlander."
Brig and Brigant meaning top or summit, in modern
Welsh, and Brigantwys the people of the summit, Brigantes has
doubtless only originally meant the dwellers in the hilly country.
The habits of the brigands of Greece, Spain, and Italy, of the
present day, sufficiently account for its application to mountain
hordes organised for the purposes of plunder and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Aryan mythology will supply a common source for all
these local appellations. Walter K. Kelly ("Curiosities of Indo-European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Tradition") says:&mdash;"Agni, the god of fire (Latin, <i>ignis</i>),
has for retainers the Bhrigus and the Angirases. They are his priests
on earth whilst they dwell there in mortal form; and after death they
are his friends and companions in heaven. They are also the companions
of the clouds and storms"&mdash;in other words, personifications
of some characteristics of clouds and storms. He afterwards speaks
of "<i>Bhrigu, the father of a mythological family of that name</i>." The root
of the word means "<i>fulgent burning</i>." The Bhrigus and a kindred
mythical race, the Phlegyans, incurred the displeasure of the gods.
The latter were condemned to the torments of Tartarus. Bhrigu,
being an ancestor of the Brahmans, was more leniently treated. His
father, Varuna, however, sent him "on a penitential tour to several
hells, that he might see how the wicked are punished, and be warned
by their fate."</p>

<p>The clouds and storms of the Alpine mountains and the Lancashire
and Yorkshire hills would amply justify the appellation of the term
Brigantium, or the country of the Brigantes, in the minds of Aryan
emigrants, to both localities. The Bhrigus, according to Dr. Kuhn,
were "brewers" of storms, or yielders of the heavenly soma, the
drink of the gods; in other words, the distillers of rain water, which
rendered the earth fruitful. The country of the Brigantes is the term
given by the Roman historians to that part of England which lies
north of the Humber and the Mersey, and includes the lesser tribes
named the Volantii and the Setantii, or Sistuntii, which occupied the
western or Lancashire coast, and perhaps that of Cumberland.</p>

<p>Another very common name on altars in the north of England is
Vitires, Vetiris, or Veteres. Mr. Thomas Wright regards this as a
"foreign deity," and thinks "it must have belonged to a national
mythology." But he adds, "As the altars were dedicated apparently
by people of widely different countries, they give us no assistance in
appropriating this deity. The word has been supposed to be identical
with Vithris, one of the names of the northern Odin, the Woden of
the Germans." This name for Odin has evidently some relationship
to the Vritra (or Ahi, the dragon) of the Hindoo Vedas.</p>

<p>Some altars have been found at Lancaster and in Cumberland,
dedicated to Cocidius or Cocideus. According to the Ravenna manuscript,
it is probable a temple to this god existed near the Roman
Wall, of sufficient importance to name the place Fanococidi. The
name of this god may probably be traced to an Aryan source. I can,
however, at present, offer no better suggestion than that it may have
some reference to the Stygian ferryman, which is of Aryan origin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
The river or arm of the sea over which the dead are ferried, by
Charon, is variously named by the Greeks as the Styx, the Acheron,
and the Cocytus. Perhaps the latter term may likewise furnish
a clue to the derivation of the name Coccium of the Itineraries,
which I and others have placed at Walton, near Preston.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It
has previously been suggested by others that this station may
have been named after either the god Cocidius or the Emperor
Cocceius Nerva. The assumption that it was derived from Cocytus
or Cocidius would in no way vitiate the truthfulness of the usual
derivation from the Keltic <i>coch gwi</i>, or red water, from the red rock
in the Ribble, as it is easy to imagine such a description to have been
given to the "river of death." That the station was named after
Cocceius Nerva is improbable, as all the known evidence, including
the site, coins, and the British foundation beneath the Roman remains,
indicate it to have been one of Agricola's posts. He entered
Lancashire in the year 79, and Nerva did not commence his reign
until 96. He only reigned about two years.</p>

<p>A very large proportion of the names of mountains and streams
in any part of Britain are corruptions, in a greater or lesser degree,
of words belonging to the aboriginal or Keltic tongue. With the aid
of the Welsh, the Gaelic, and the Irish, the meaning of many can
be satisfactorily ascertained, such as the Darwen (Dwrgwen, white,
or beautiful stream), Wyre (gwyr, pure, lively), Old Man (alt maen,
high hill), Pennygent (Penygwyn, white head or summit), or, which
I think better, Pen y gwynt, windy head or summit, from its exposed
situation. Others are, however, by no means so satisfactorily explained
on similar grounds. Mr. Davies in a very able contribution
to the Philological Society's Transactions, on "The Races of Lancashire,"
with reference to the Ribble, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The name of this well known river has much perplexed antiquarian
philologists. I can only venture to suggest that it may be compounded
of rhe (active, fleet), and bala (a shooting out, a discharge,
the outlet of a lake), and may refer to its rapid course as an estuary."</p>

<p>With our knowledge, from Ptolemy, of the existence of a "Belisama
Estuarium" on the Lancashire coast, in the second century, and
which can be otherwise shown, on the best available evidence, to
apply to the Ribble, the Rhi-bell, or River Bell, is a much more satisfactory
derivation; and more especially so as a god <i>bel</i> or <i>beil</i> of the
<i>beltain</i> fires is conceded (as I have previously shown) to the early
Keltic inhabitants of Britain. The altar, recently found at Ribchester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>,
dedicated to the British god Belatucadrus, proves, at least,
that votaries of that deity dwelt in the Ribble valley, as well as in
Cumberland, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Godfrey Higgins, in his "Celtic Druids," speaks of Samhan or
Saman as "one of the gods, the most revered in Ireland." He
says:&mdash;"An annual solemnity was instituted to his honour, which is
yet celebrated on the evening of the first day of November, which yet
at this day is called the <i>Oidhche Samhna</i>, or the night of <i>Samhan</i>."
He further informs us that he was "also called <i>Bal-Sab</i> or Lord of
Death," and that "<i>Samhan</i> was also the sun, or rather the image of
the sun," and adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These attributes of <i>Samhan</i> seem at first contradictory, but they
are not unusual amongst the heathen gods. With the Greeks,
Dionysos, the good Demiurge, is identified with Hades. In Egypt,
Osiris was the lord of Death; with the Scandinavians, Odin, the
god beneficent, was, at the same time, King of the infernal regions.
This deity was above all the others whom we have named, but he
was below the supreme being Baal. If Samhan were the sun, as we
see he was, he answers to Mithra of the Persians, who was the
middle link between Oromasdes and Arimanes&mdash;between the Creator
and the Destroyer, and was called the <i>Preserver</i>."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>With the aid of the Hindoo Vedas, perhaps some light may be
thrown on this subject, as well as upon the origin of the names of
some other rivers in the neighbourhood, which have hitherto eluded
satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>The gods of the Vedas appear to have been, more or less, personifications
of what were termed "the elements." The sun, the
moon, the sky or firmament, the dawn and evening twilight, the sea,
lightning, clouds, rain, wind, frost, fire, &amp;c., and their attendant
active phenomena, contributed mainly to the construction of their
mythological edifice. Indra was god of the firmament, the earliest
thunderer, the forerunner of Zeus, Jupiter and Thor; Agni was the
god of fire, and Soma was the deity who brought down to earth the
celestial liquor, the "drink of the gods," the amrita of the Vedas,
the nectar of the Greeks. Soma was so designated because the
"soma plant, which the Hindoos now identify with the <i>Asclepias
acida</i> or <i>Sarcostemma viminale</i>," contained "a milky juice of a sweetish
sub-acid flavour, which, being mixed with honey and other ingredients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
yielded to the enraptured Aryans the first fermented liquor
their race had ever known." All celestial or atmospheric phenomena
were named from earthly objects. Clouds were called rocks
and cows, and the mountain streams of the former and the milk of
the latter were the liquid nourishers and fertilisers of the soil. The
lightning-god was believed to pierce the rock or the rain cloud, and
so water the parched earth. Walter Kelly says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The identity of the heavenly soma with the cloud-water, and the
close connection in which fire and soma are brought in various Aryan
legends, prove that the drink of the gods was conceived to be a product
of the storm. It appears also that the earthly soma was boiled
or brewed before it was fermented, whence it must have followed, as
a matter of course, that its divine counterpart should be supposed to
undergo the same process. Hence it is manifest that we cannot
claim for any of the later ages the credit of having invented the
metaphor involved in the common saying, 'It's brewing a storm.'
In that phrase, as in many others, we only repeat the thoughts of
our prim&aelig;val ancestors."</p>

<p>Dr. Kuhn identifies the modern word <i>brew</i> with the <i>brajj</i> of the
Rig Veda, which has reference to the roasting of barley for brewing
purposes, and is intimately connected with the Bhrigus, beings who
"brewed and lightened" the heavenly soma out of the stormy phenomena
of the mountain regions. In the Welsh of the present day,
<i>brygu</i> means to grow out, to overspread. One modern Welsh word,
<i>brwysg</i>, means drunk, and another <i>brwys</i>, fertile, luxuriant. The
double use of the term at the present time, is, therefore, in singular
harmony with the hypothesis of Kuhn, and adds much to its probability.
Kelly says:&mdash;"One of the synonyms of soma is <i>madhu</i>,
which means a mixed drink; and this word is the <i>methu</i> of the
Greeks, and the <i>mead</i> of our own Saxon, Norse, and Celto-British
ancestors."</p>

<p>Near Rutchester, in Northumberland, the ancient Vindobala, is an
excavation made in the solid rock, the cause or use of which is not
with certainty known. It is 12 feet long, 4&frac12; feet broad, and 2 feet
deep, "and has a hole close to the bottom at one end." It is locally
named the "Giant's Grave." It is not improbable, from remains discovered
near it, that it has had some connection with a temple dedicated
to the worship of Mithras. A manuscript by Sir David Smith,
preserved in Alnwick Castle, referring to this singular excavation,
says:&mdash;"The old peasants here have a tradition that the Romans
made a beverage somewhat like beer of the bells of heather (heath),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and that this trough was used in the process of making such drink."
Dr. Collingwood Bruce, commenting on the above, says:&mdash;"The
opinion long prevailed in Northumberland that the <i>Picts</i> had the art
of preparing an intoxicating liquor from heather-bells, and that the
secret died with them."</p>

<p>The names of the gods underwent much change as time advanced,
and the race was scattered. Bel became the <i>luminous deity</i> of some of
the settlers in Britain; Soma became a higher deity in importance
than Indra or Agni, and absorbed their attributes. In the Zend version
the drink soma is spelled haoma. The hymns addressed to Soma, in a
later age, are styled Sama Vedas. Hence it may easily be inferred the
Belisama of Ptolemy is a Latinised form of the British words which
indicated that the Ribble water was the "liquor of the gods" furnished
by Bel and Sama for the fertilisation of the earth. The hoary rocky
mountains of Pennygent, Ingleborough, and Pendle, and the storm-clouds
that contended with lightning about their summits, furnish
sufficiently characteristic natural phenomena to justify the appropriateness
of the appellation. This deification of rivers was by no means
an uncommon occurrence. Sir William Betham, in his "Gael and
Cymbri," says, expressly, "the Celt&aelig; were much addicted to the
worship of fountains and rivers as divinities. They had a deity
called Divona, or the river-god." The Wharf, which springs not far
from the source of the Ribble, received these honours from legionaries
of Rome or some of their auxiliaries, who appear to have worshipped
the stream as the water-goddess "Verbeia." The Roman name
appears to be merely a Latin form of the ancient British word of which
the modern name Wharf is a corruption. The Lune, too, appears to
have had similar honours conferred upon it, as is evidenced by an
altar found at Skerton, near Lancaster, inscribed <span class="smcapl">DEO JALONO</span>.
The word <i>Lune</i> was anciently written <i>Lone</i>, and the hundred is still
named Lonsdale. Indeed, the personification of rivers is not yet
extinct. We speak of "Old Father Thames" to this day.</p>

<p>The Ituna Estuarium of Ptolemy is universally assigned to the
Solway, the chief river entering it being called the Eden at the present
time. As <i>t</i> and <i>d</i> are convertible, and the Latin <i>i</i> was pronounced <i>e</i>,
as on the continent now, Eduna most probably expresses to our ears
the ancient sound, which is the exact counterpart of the modern
one, the Latin terminal letter not entering into the question. Does
the Vedic and Teutonic mythologies throw any light on the derivation
of this name? Kelly says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The cloud-maidens are known in the Vedas as <i>Apas</i> (waters), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
are styled brides of the gods (D&ecirc;vapatnis) and <i>N&aacute;vyah</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, navigators
of the celestial sea. Nearly related to them, but less divine, are the
<i>Apsarases</i>; damsels whose habitat is between the earth and the sun.
They are the houris of the Vedic paradise, destined to delight the
souls of heroes. Their name means either 'the formless' or 'the
water going,' and they appear to have been personifications of the
manifold but ill-defined forms of the mists; but other natural
phenomena may also have been represented under their image."</p>

<p>Kelly further informs us that these inferior cloud-maidens possessed
raiment or "shirts of swan plumage," by means of which they
"transformed themselves into water-fowl, especially swans." He adds
that "the Persian peris, and the German swan-maidens, changed
their forms in the same way, and by the same means." Indeed, they
are "the originals" of these "swan-maidens," and are closely related
to the Elves, Mahrs, and Valkyries, of the Teutonic mythology. The
same writer further states that "Odin's Valkyries (riders in the wild
hunt) had their swan-shirts, and the Norse goddess Freyja" (from
whence our Friday), "had her falcon-shirt,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which she lent to Loki,
when he went in quest of Thor's stolen hammer, and to rescue Idunn,"
(elsewhere spelled Idhunn) "the goddess of youth, from captivity
among the frost giants. Thiassi, who kept her in custody, had an
eagle-shirt, and his follow giant, Suttungr, had another, in which he
pursued Odin."</p>

<p>These wild riders of the stormy sky, like their prototypes in the
Vedas, personify or typify "rain senders." Mr. Kelly says, in the
Teutonic form of the myth, the manes of their horses "dropped dew
upon the earth, filled the drinking horns for the gods and the warriors
in Odin's hall; and like them, white maidens, elves, and witches offer
full goblets and horns to thankless mortals, who usually run away
with the beaker after spilling its contents on the ground."</p>

<p>It is a somewhat singular circumstance that the most celebrated
relict of this old pagan superstition, or myth, is preserved at Edenhall,
on the bank of the very river to which I am referring. Tradition
says the goblet was secured, in the orthodox way, by an ancestor
of the Musgraves, or one of his retainers, ages ago. Sir Walter Scott
has rendered the story immortal. He makes the following distich
salute the ears of the bold plunderer, as he hurriedly decamps from
the fairy revel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If this glass do break or fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell the luck of Edenhall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>The "Luck of Edenhall," as the very ancient glass vessel is styled,
is believed to be of Venetian manufacture, and dates, probably, from
the century preceding the Norman conquest.</p>

<p>The Rev. G. W. Cox, in his valuable work on the "Mythology of
the Aryan Nations," ranks this cup amongst the numerous phallic
symbols. Referring to this subject, he says:&mdash;"We have seen the
myth starting from its crude and undisguised form, assume the more
harmless shape of goblets or horns of plenty and fertility; of rings
and crosses, of rods and spears, of mirrors and lamps. It has
brought before us the mysterious ships endowed with the powers of
thought and speech, beautiful cups in which the wearied sun sinks to
rest, the staff of wealth and plenty with which Hermes guides the
cattle of Helios across the blue pastures of heaven, the cup of
D&ecirc;met&ecirc;r into which the ripe fruit casts itself by an irresistible impulse.
We have seen the symbols assume the character of talismanic
tests, by which the refreshing draught is dashed from the lips of the
guilty; and, finally, in the exquisite legend of the Sangreal the symbols
have become a sacred thing, only the pure in heart may see and
touch."</p>

<p>The goddess of youth (Idunn), with her attendant swans and water-fowl,
is not an inapt personification of the lovely Eden, in its lower
course; while the wild moors and crags, where the eagles nestled,
and amongst which its many tributary streamlets spring, aptly enough
answers to the homes of the frost giants, who, in severe winters, held
captive the congealed waters.</p>

<p>It may be thought that this, being a Teutonic etymology, is not so
satisfactory as if it were Keltic. But its pertinence is corroborated
by the fact that, in the Welsh of the present day, <i>edn</i> means fowl or
bird, <i>edyn</i> winged one, and <i>ednyw</i> spirit, essence.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his work on "First Principles," when
treating of "Laws in General," argues elaborately on the order in
which the sense of law, or a recognition of "that constant course of
procedure" which the term implies, was gradually developed in the
human intellect. After showing that there are several derivative principles,
some earlier arrived at than others from the relative frequency
of the occurring phenomena and their immediate influence upon, or of
"personal concern" to, the aboriginal savage, he has some observations
very pertinent to the present question. He says:&mdash;"The solidification
of water at a low temperature is a phenomenon that is simple,
concrete, and of much personal concern. But it is neither so frequent
as those which we saw are earliest generalised, nor is the <i>presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the antecedent so uniformly conspicuous</i>. Though in all but tropical
climates, mid-winter displays the relation between cold and freezing
with tolerable constancy; yet, during the spring and autumn, the
occasional appearance of ice in the mornings has not very manifest
connection with the coldness of the weather. Sensation being so
inaccurate a measure, it is not possible for the savage to experience
the definite relation between a temperature of 32&deg; and the congealing
of water; and hence the long-continued conception of <i>personal</i> agency.
Similarly, but still more clearly, with the winds, the absence of
regularity, and the inconspicuousness of the antecedents, allowing
the mythological explanation to survive for a great period."</p>

<p>The names of the Severn and the Dee, and some other rivers or
estuaries, will admit of similar interpretation from similar sources.
Mr. Kelly says:&mdash;"The collective appellation of the Vedic gods is
D&ecirc;vas, and this name has passed into most of the Indo-European
languages; for corresponding to the Sanscrit <i>d&ecirc;va</i> is the Latin <i>deus</i>,
Greek <i>the&oacute;s</i>, Lithuanian <i>d&eacute;was</i>, Lettish <i>dews</i>, Old Prussian <i>deiws</i>,
Irish <i>dia</i>, Welsh <i>duw</i>, Cornish <i>duy</i>. Amongst the German races the
word <i>d&ecirc;va</i> survives only in the Norse plural <i>t&igrave;var</i>, gods; and amongst
those of the Sclave stock the Servians alone preserve a trace of it in
the word <i>diw</i>, giant. The da&ecirc;vas of the Medes and Persians were in
early times degraded from the rank of gods to that of demons by a
religious revolution, just as the heathen gods of the Germans were
declared by the Christian missionaries to be devils; and the modern
Persian <i>div</i>, and Armenian <i>dev</i>, mean an evil spirit. D&ecirc;va is derived
from <i>div</i>, heaven (properly 'the shining'), and means the heavenly
being."</p>

<p>This appears to be a satisfactory and conclusive answer to a very
pertinent question put by George Borrow in the last chapter of his
work on "Wild Wales." He says:&mdash;"How is it that the Sanscrit
<i>devila</i> stands for what is wise and virtuous, and the English devil for
all that is desperate and wicked?" A similar answer is given to
this question by the fate which the Teutonic gods of Western Europe
underwent on the final triumph of Christianity. Dasent says:&mdash;"They
were cast down from honour, but not from power. They lost
their genial kindly influence as the protectors of men and the origin
of all things good; but their existence was tolerated; they became
powerful for ill, and degenerated into malignant demons."</p>

<p>In the Hindoo mythology, it appears revolutions took place at a
very early date. In the early Vedic hymns D&ecirc;va is "addressed as
Dyanish pit&acirc;, <i>i.e.</i>, Heaven Father, and his wife is Mata Prithivi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Mother Earth. He is the Zeus Pater of the Greeks, the Jupiter of
the Romans, the German Tius, and the Norse Tyr. Dyanish pit&acirc;
was the god of the blue firmament, but even in the Vedic times his
grandeur was considerably on the wane. Indra, the new lord of the
firmament, had left him little more than a titular sovereignty in his
own domain, while Varuna, another heavenly monarch, who was still
in the plenitude of his power, commanded more respect than the <i>roi
fain&eacute;ant</i>, his neighbour. The all-covering Varuna,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the Uranos of
the Greeks, was lord of the celestial sea and of the realm of light
above it, that highest heaven in which the Fathers dwelt with their
King Yama. After the southern branch of the Aryans had entered
India, Varuna was brought down from the upper regions, to be thenceforth
the god of the earthly sea, which had then for the first time
become known to his votaries."</p>

<p>May not this Varun be possibly the true root of the name Severn?
Etymologists are not at all agreed as to its derivation. Some say it
was anciently called Hafren, and that this term is identical with
Severn, the latter being merely a corruption of the former. This is
the prevalent opinion. The Severn, indeed, yet retains the name
Hafren, from its source to Llanidloes. Its principal upper tributary
which enters it a little below Welshpool is called the Vyrnwy. May
not this be the true Welsh root of the word? If such be the case,
there is nothing improbable in the conjecture that Hafren is a Keltic
corruption of the Sanscrit Varun, especially as the <i>f</i> and <i>v</i> are readily
"convertible." The Se may be a prefix, of which more anon.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his "British History," states that King
Locrin divorced his queen Guendol&#339;na, and married a beautiful captive
named Estrildis. On the death of the king, the divorced queen
commanded "Estrildis and her daughter Sabre to be thrown into
the river now called the Severn, and published an edict through all
Britain that the river should bear the damsel's name, hoping by this
to perpetuate her memory, and by that the infamy of her husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
So that to this day the river is called in the British tongue Sabren,
which by the corruption of the name is, in another language,
Sabrina."</p>

<p>Milton, speaking of Sabrina as the goddess of the river, styles her
"the daughter of Locrine, that had the sceptre from his father
Brute." As the mythical or rather non-historical character of Brute
and his progeny is now almost universally conceded, it is not improbable
that the river named the maiden (if she ever existed in
the flesh) rather than that her immersion changed its designation.
Sabrina, or Savrina (for the <i>b</i> and <i>v</i> are convertible), may therefore
but be the Latinised form of the old Welsh Hafren and the Sanscrit
Varuna, with the prefix <i>se</i> added thereto.</p>

<p>The Dee is described as the Seteia Estuarium by Ptolemy. The
Roman city Deva (Chester) was situated on its banks. The <i>se</i> is
generally regarded as a prefix in this case, and it may likewise be so
in the word Severn. <i>D</i> and <i>t</i> being convertible, the names of the
river and city evidently spring from one root. The Rev. John
Whitaker, the historian of Manchester, in interpreting the term
Se-tan-tiu, says it may mean "the inferior or southerly country of
water, and express the particular position of Lancashire with respect
to the Volantii and the sea."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Se, in these cases, may have a somewhat similar import, or it
may have reference to the Vedic great serpent Sesha, concerning
which there is a curious story in the Hindoo poems. The D&ecirc;vas had
been at war with their enemies, the Asuras, and, being thirsty with
the work (or the country needing rain), a truce was agreed upon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
both sides joined their efforts "in churning the ocean to procure
amrita" (or soma) "the drink of immortality. They took Mount
Mandara for a churning stick, and wrapping the great serpent Sesha
round it for a rope, they made the mountain spin round to and fro,
the D&ecirc;vas pulling at the serpent's tail, and the Asuras at its head.
Mount Mandara was more anciently written Manthara, and Manthara
is the Sanscrit name of the churning stick which is used by every
dairy in India."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The purely figurative character of this is easily
seen. It is but another form of expressing the fertilisation of the
earth by means of the rain which is engendered by the "strife of the
elements." The churning stick and cord are but another form of
the Hindoo pramantha, or fire churn, "or chark," by which the
sacred or "need-fire" was produced amongst the Greeks and
Romans, as well as the Kelt&aelig; and other Aryan tribes, before the
discovery of the use of flint and steel. The "chark" represented
the power of the sun, and it is not impossible our remote Eastern
ancestors were aware that the sun really does, in a sense, "churn"
or "brew" the ocean water, and distribute its vapours over mountain
and plain, and by this means convert even an otherwise barren
wilderness into a fertile garden, making it literally "blossom like the
rose."</p>

<p>That this superstition has not yet become extinct in India is
attested by the following paragraph, which appeared in the newspapers
in the year 1869:&mdash;"The inhabitants of Burmah have an
idea that pulling at a rope will produce rain. Two parties tug
against each other. One is a raining party, the other is a fair
weather party. By previous arrangement the rain party are allowed
to be victorious. On the occasion of the late continued drought this
proceeding was attended with the happiest results."</p>

<p>Geoffrey of Monmouth says that an "invading king of the Huns,
named Humber, was defeated by Locrin on the banks of that river,
and drowned in its flood, on account of which it has since borne his
name." This, of course, is merely idle romance. Some writers contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that the name was originally Chumber, that Northumberland
means North Cumri-land, of which the present Cumberland is a relic.
It is not improbable that the Mersey derived its name from Mercia,
or the territory from the boundary river. It, in conjunction with the
Humber, divided Northumbria from Mercia during the heptarchy.
The Mersey is still called the Cheshire Waters by some of the inhabitants
on the south-west of Manchester.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that no Roman writer or Itinerary mentions
the Humber. Ptolemy speaks of a river Abus, which is generally
identified with that stream, but this helps us not to the etymology of
the modern name. It is not altogether improbable, however, that
the Aryan mythology may throw some light upon the ancient appellations.
We are informed by Max M&uuml;ller that, previous to the dispersion
of the Aryan tribes, the Ribhus were called Arbhus, and that
this latter term is identical with the Greek Orpheus. From this root
likewise is derived the German Alb or Alp; plural <i>Elbe</i> or Elfen;
English Elf, with its plural Elves. In the modern Welsh the word
<i>elod</i> means intelligence, spirit, <i>elaeth</i> spiritual being, and <i>elford</i> both
demon and intellectual existence. The Rev. G. W. Cox says that
Alpheios, the mythic huntsman, "is the child of the waters....
He is, in short, the Elf, or water sprite, whose birth-place is the Elbe,
or flowing stream." If the name of the German river <i>Elbe</i> (Albis) be
derived from this source, the probability is heightened that the Abus of
Ptolemy may have intimate relationship to the Aryan Arbhus, or
Ribhus. These mystic beings were followers, like the Bhrigus and
the Maruts, of Agni and Indra, "personifications of fire and firmament."
Kelly says:&mdash;"The element of the Ribhus is rather that of
the sunbeams or the lightning, though they too rule the winds, and
sing, like the Maruts, the loud song of the storm.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Their name means
the 'artificers,' and not even the divine workman of Olympus was
more skilled than they in all kinds of handicraft. The armour and
weapons of the gods, the chariots of the Asvins (deities of the dawn),
the thunderbolt and the lightning steed of Indra, were of their workmanship.
They made their old decrepid parents young and supple-jointed
again. But the feat for which they were most renowned is the
revival of the slaughtered cow on which the gods had feasted. Out
of the hide alone these wonder-working Ribhus reproduced the
perfect living animal; and this they did not once, but again and
again. <i>In other words, out of a small portion of the imperishable cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that had melted away in rain and seemed destroyed, they reproduced its
whole form and substance.</i>"</p>

<p>Similar feats were ascribed to the Northern thunder-god, Thor,
whose practice it was to kill the two buck goats that drew his car,
cook them for supper, and bring them to life again next morning by
touching them with his hammer.</p>

<p>Kelly further adds that in "the gloomy season of the winter solstice
the Ribhus <i>sleep for twelve days in the house of the sun-god Savitar</i>;
then they <i>wake up and prepare the earth to clothe itself anew with vegetation,
and the</i> <span class="smcapl">FROZEN WATERS TO FLOW</span> <i>again</i>."</p>

<p>The tributaries of the Humber are remarkable on account of their
liabilities to sudden floods; and their constant recurrence, after long
periods of drought, would suggest to a prim&aelig;val people the interference
of celestial beings which possessed the attributes assigned to
these Arbhus or Ribhus. Referring to the Greek form of this myth,
Kelly says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We see how the cruder idea of the Ribhus sweeping trees and rocks
in wild dance before them by the force of their stormy song grew
under the beautifying touch of the Hellenic imagination into the
legend of that master of the lyre whose magic tones made <i>torrents
pause and listen, rocks and trees descend with delight from their mountain
beds</i>, and moved even Pluto's unrelenting heart to pity."</p>

<p>The estuary on the opposite coast of Britain to the Severn, now
known as the Wash, is called by Ptolemy, Metaris. May not this
name have had, originally, some connection with Varuna's friend
Mithra? Kelly says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the sun was still a wheel, a store of gold, a swan or a
flamingo, an eagle, falcon, horse, and many other things, it was also
the eye of Varuna; just as amongst the Anglo-Saxons and other
Germans it was held to be the eye of Woden. Varuna and Mithra
(the friend), <i>the god of daylight</i>, used to sit together at morning on a
golden throne, and journey at even in a brazen car."</p>

<p>The sun, at the dawn at least, gilded the waves of the eastern
estuary, and shed its ruddier glow at evening on the western or
Severn sea. Under any interpretation, the coincidence of so many
names and half-hidden characteristics, to say the least, is very
remarkable.</p>

<p>There is nothing extravagant in this attempt to show that the
terms thus applied conveyed both a literal, or earthly, as well
as a figurative, or celestial, meaning. All mythology is fashioned out
of such materials. Primitive languages are limited in the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
their words, and, of necessity, are highly figurative. The tongues of
all the North American Indians, as well as those of the tribes of Aryan
and Semitic origin, markedly exhibit this peculiarity. Farrer, in his
essay on the "Origin of Language," says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To call things which we have never seen before by the name of
that which most nearly resembles them is a practice of every-day life.
That children at first call all men 'father' and all women 'mother' is
an observation as old as Aristotle. The Romans gave the name of
Lucanian <i>ox</i> to the elephant, and <i>camelopardus</i> to the giraffe, just as
the New Zealanders are stated to have called horses <i>large dogs</i>. The
astonished Caffers gave the name of <i>cloud</i> to the first parasol which
they had seen; and similar instances might be adduced almost
indefinitely. They prove that it is an instinct, if it be not a necessity,
to borrow for the unknown the names already used for things
known."</p>

success which had attended the labours of M. Lejean, who had been sent by the
French government "on a journey of scientific exploration to India and the Persian
Gulf." M. Lejean, in a letter from Abushehr (Bendershehr), reports to the French
Minister of Public Instruction, discoveries "of so extraordinary a nature," that the
writer in the <i>Gazette</i> "scarcely likes to repeat them without further confirmation."
Amongst other matters, he says:&mdash;"They extend from the oldest times to the
Alexandrine period, and from the Arians to Buddhism. He speaks of having discovered
ante-Sanscrit idioms (<i>langues pal&eacute;o-ariennes</i>) 'still spoken between Kashmir
and Afghanistan by the mountain tribes,' and he undertakes to prove 'that these
languages have a more direct connection with the European languages than Sanscrit.'"

accompanied a paper, published in the third volume of "Asiatic Researches, in 1801."
Speke, referring to this paper, says:&mdash;"It was written by Lieutenant Wilford, from
the 'Purans' of the ancient Hindus.... It is remarkable that the Hindus have
christened the source of the Nile <i>Amara</i>, which is the name of a country at the north-east
corner of the Victoria N'yanza. This, I think, shows clearly, that the ancient Hindus
must have had some kind of communication with both the northern and southern ends
of the Victoria N'yanza." I find on this map, on the west side of the inland sea
styled "Lake of Amara or of the Gods," a range of hills named "<i>Sitanta M<sup>ts</sup></i>."
They are in close contiguity to the "<i>Soma Giri</i>" or "Mountains of the Moon," and
seem to be a lower or inferior branch of that range, bordering upon the waters of the
great lake. This appears to be a further confirmation of the high probability which
exists that some of the very ancient local nomenclature of Britain and Western
Europe is of Eastern origin. Ptolemy speaks not only of a people inhabiting the
district of which Lancashire forms a part, which he names the <i>Setantii</i>, but of a
harbour on the coast, the <i>Portus Setantiorum</i>, which I and others have fixed at the
Wyre. [See "History of Preston and its Environs." p. 36.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The second "Avat&acirc;ra" of Vishnu was in the form of a tortoise, when Vishnu
placed himself under the mountain Mandara, while the gods and demons churned the
Milky Sea for ambrosia. This incarnation is called the <i>Kurma</i>. This churning
appears to have produced other miraculous results. Amongst the "gifts" of the ocean
on this auspicious occasion, two especially fell to the share of Vishnu himself, namely,
a miraculous jewel, named <i>Kaustubha</i>, and S'r&icirc;, the goddess of Beauty and Prosperity.
The Venus of the Greeks was said to have been produced from the foam of the sea,
in the neighbourhood of the island <i>Cythera</i>, hence one of the numerous appellations
of the goddess&mdash;<i>Cytherea</i>.</p></div>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">I have</span> said that some remains of the fire worship of Bel or Beil,
until very recently, might be found in Lancashire and the North of
England, as well as at present in Scotland and Ireland. Indeed, I
am inclined to think certain English customs of the peasantry, at
the present day, may, with perfect truthfulness, be referred to this
source, although the original objects of the ceremonies may have
been, either wholly or in part, obliterated by time, or obscured by the
action of more recent rites and traditional observances.</p>

<p>Amongst these may be instanced a superstition prevalent in the
North of England and many other places, that a funeral procession,
when arrived at the churchyard, must move in the sun's course; that
is, from east to west; otherwise evil resulted to the spirit of the
departed. This sentiment is not confined to religious ceremonies,
but is respected when passing the bottle in convivial assemblies; and
in several other matters of ordinary every-day life. The fact that
Brand, and most of the earlier writers after the Reformation, speak
of these superstitions as "Popish," in no way invalidates the assignment
to them of an Aryan origin. As early as the eleventh century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in the reign of Canute the Great, we find laws strictly prohibiting
the people from worshipping, or venerating, "the sun, moon, sacred
groves and woods, and hallowed hills and fountains." Decrees were
again and again pronounced in vain against many of these practices
by the ecclesiastical authorities. In the canons of the Northumberland
clergy, quoted by Wilkins and Hallam, we read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If a king's thane deny this (<i>the practice of heathen superstition</i>),
let twelve be appointed for him, and let him take twelve of his
kindred (or equals, <i>maga</i>), and twelve British strangers; and if he
fail, then let him pay for his breach of law, twelve half-marcs: if a
landowner (or lesser thane) deny the charge, let as many of his
equals and as many strangers be taken as for a royal thane; and if
he fail, let him pay six half-marcs: If a ceorl deny it, let as many of
his equals and as many strangers be taken for him as for the others;
and if he fail, let him pay twelve or&aelig; for his breach of law."</p>

<p>This demonstrates that all classes, whatever their rank, found it
difficult to shake off the superstitions of their forefathers. Some of
them became amalgamated with more modern festive ceremonies, and
were eventually intermingled with the formul&aelig; of the Christian worship
itself. Sir Jno. Lubbock, in his recent work, "The Origin of Civilization
and the Primitive Condition of Man," endorses this view. He says:
"When man, either by natural progress, or the influence of a more
advanced race, rises to the conception of a higher religion, <i>he still
retains his old beliefs, which long linger on, side by side with</i>, and yet in
utter opposition to, the higher creed. The new and more powerful
spirit is an addition to the old Pantheon, and diminishes the importance
of the older deities; gradually, the worship of the latter sinks
in the social scale, and becomes confined to the ignorant and the young.
Thus a belief in witchcraft still flourishes among our agricultural
labourers and the lowest classes in our great cities, and the deities of
our ancestors survive in the nursery tales of our children. We must,
therefore, expect to find in each race, traces&mdash;nay, more than traces&mdash;of
lower religions."</p>

<p>In the Irish Glossary of Cormac, Archbishop of Cashel, written in
the beginning of the tenth century, the author says, in his time
"four great fires were lighted up on the four great festivals of the
Druids, viz., in February, May, August, and November." General
Valancey says the Irish have discontinued their November fires and
substituted candles; while the Welsh, though they retain the fire,
"can give no reason for the illumination." All Saints' Day is on the
first of November, and its vigil is termed Allhalloween, or Nutcrack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
night. Those festivals had all reference to the seasons, and their
influence on the fruitfulness of the earth. Brand says "it is customary
on this night with young people in the north of England to
dive for apples, or catch at them, when stuck upon one end of a kind of
hanging beam, at the other extremity of which is fixed a lighted
candle, and that with their mouths only, their hands being tied
behind their backs." Robert Burns tells us that Halloween is
thought to be a "night when witches, devils, and other mischief
making beings, are all abroad on their baneful midnight errands;
particularly those &aelig;rial people, the fairies, are said on that night to
hold a grand anniversary." Scotch girls, on this evening, pull, blindfolded,
cabbage stalks, in order to divine the size and figure of their
future husbands. Nuts are roasted or flung into the fire for a
similar purpose both in Scotland and England. Gay describes the
latter ceremony as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two hazel nuts I threw into the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to each nut I gave a sweetheart's name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This with the <i>loudest bounce</i> me sore amazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in a <i>flame of brightest colour</i> blazed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As blazed the nut so may thy passion grow</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'twas thy nut that did so brightly glow!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We possess some interesting accounts of these gatherings in various
parts of Scotland during the latter portion of the last century. In
Perthshire, heath, broom, and dressings of flax were tied to poles,
lighted, and carried round the villages and fields. One minister says
the people "set up bonfires in every village. When the bonfire is
consumed, the ashes are carefully collected into the form of a circle.
There is a stone put in near the circumference, for every person of the
several families interested in the bonfire; and whatever stone is
removed out of its place or injured before the next morning, the person
represented by that stone is devoted, or <i>fey</i>, and is supposed not to
live twelve months from that day. The people received the consecrated
fire from the Druid priests next morning, the virtues of which were
supposed to continue a year." A similar authority says, "the custom
of making a fire in the fields, baking a consecrated cake, &amp;c., on the
1st of May is not yet quite worn out."</p>

<p>In Derbyshire these fires were called <i>Tindles</i>, and were kindled at
the close of the last century. In some localities the ceremony is called
a <i>Tinley</i>. Sir William Dugdale says, "On All-Hallow Even the
master of the family anciently used to carry a bunch of straw, fired,
about his corne, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 11em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fire and red low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light on my <i>teen low</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>In Lancashire they are called <i>tandles</i> and <i>teanlas</i>. In Ireland May-day
eve is called <i>neen na Bealtina</i>, the eve of Bael fires. The practice
of divination by the roasting of nuts is yet common in Lancashire.
The hollow cinder, too, which leaps from a coal fire, is supposed to
augur wealth or death to the person against whom it strikes, in
proportion as its shape nearest resembles a purse or a coffin.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornber, the historian of Blackpool, and Mr. T. T. Wilkinson,
of Burnley, author of a series of valuable papers on Lancashire superstitions
published in the "Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire
Historic Society," have furnished some curious information of a
local character with reference to this ancient fire-worship. The latter
says:&mdash;"Such fires are still lighted in Lancashire, on Hallowe'en,
under the names of Beltains or Teanleas; and even the <i>cakes</i> which
the Jews are said to have made in honour of the Queen of Heaven,
are yet to be found at this season amongst the inhabitants of the
banks of the Ribble.... Both the fires and cakes, however,
are now connected with superstitious notions respecting purgatory,
&amp;c., but their origin and perpetuation will scarcely admit of doubt."
He further observes:&mdash;"The practice of 'causing children to pass
through the fire to Moloch,' so strongly reprobated by the prophet of
old, may be cited as an instance in which Christianity has not yet
been able to efface all traces of one of the oldest forms of heathen
worship."</p>

<p>Mr. Thornber says:&mdash;"The conjoint worship of the sun and
moon, the Samen and Sama, husband and wife of nature, has been
from these early times so firmly implanted that ages have not
uprooted it. Christianity has not banished it.... In my
youth, on Hallowe'en, under the name of Teanla fires, I have seen
the hills throughout the country illuminated with sacred flames,
and I can point out many a cairn of fire-broken stones&mdash;the high
places of the votaries of Bel&mdash;where his rites have been performed
on the borders of the Ribble age after age. Nor at this day are
these mysteries silenced; with a burning whisp of straw at the point
of a fork on Sama's festival at the eve of All-hallows, the farmer in
some districts of the Fylde encircles his field to protect the coming
crop from noxious weeds, the tare and darnel; the old wife refuses
to sit the eggs under her crackling hen after sunset; the ignorant
boy sits astride a stile, as he looks at the new moon; the bride walks
not widdershins to church on her nuptial moon; and if the aged
parent addresses not the young pair in the words of Hanno, the
Carthaginian in the P&#339;nula of Plautus, 'O that the good Bel-Samen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
may favour them,' or, like the Irish peasant, 'The blessing of Sama
and Bel go with you;' still, we have often heard the benediction,
'May the sun shine bright upon you,' in accordance with the old
adage,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Blest is the corpse the rain fell on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest the bride on whom the sun shone.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>M. Du Chaillu, in his recent "Journey into Ashango-land and
further penetration into Equatorial Africa," speaks of a certain superstitious
reverence for fire and faith in its medical virtues by the
inhabitants of the region he traversed. He relates the following
beautiful story respecting their astronomical notions:&mdash;"I was not
always so solitary in taking my nightly observations, for sometimes
one and another of my men or Mayola" (the king or chief), "would
stand by me. Of course, I could never make them comprehend what
I was doing. Sometimes I used to be amused by their ideas about
the heavenly bodies. Like all other remarkable natural objects, they
are the subject of whimsical myths amongst them. According to them,
the sun and moon are of the same age, but the sun brings daylight
and gladness and the moon brings darkness, witchcraft, and death&mdash;for
death comes from sleep, and sleep commences in darkness. The
sun and moon, they say, once got angry with each other, each one
claiming to be the eldest. The moon said, 'Who are you, to dare to
speak to me? You are alone; you have no people. What! are you
to consider yourself equal to me? Look at me,' she continued, showing
the stars shining around her, 'these are my people; I am not
alone in the world like you.' The sun answered, 'Oh, moon, you
bring witchcraft, and it is you have killed all my people, or I should
have as many attendants as you.' According to the negroes, people
are more liable to die when the moon first makes her appearance and
when she is last visible. They say that she calls the people her
insects and devours them. The moon with them is the emblem of
time and death."</p>

<p>The Teutonic tribes appear, contrary to the general faith of their
Aryan kindred, to have regarded the sun as a female and the moon as
a male deity. Palgrave, in his "History of the Anglo-Saxons," says:&mdash;"They
had an odd notion that if they addressed that power as a goddess,
their wives would be their masters."</p>

<p>I am strongly inclined to think that the continuance of the practice
of lighting bonfires on the 5th of November owes quite as much
to the associations connected with the ancient teanla fires of Allhalloween,
as to any present Protestant horror of the treason of Guy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Fawkes and his band of conspirators. It may be quite true that the
House of Commons, in February, 1605-6 did ordain that the 5th of
November should be kept as "<i>a holiday</i> <span class="smcapl">FOR EVER</span> in thankfulness to
God for our deliverance, and detestation of the Papists;" but
ordinances of this class seldom produce more than a temporary
excitement amongst large masses of the people. I remember, in my
youth, "assisting" at the celebration of several "bonfire days"
in Preston and its neighbourhood, sometimes as amateur pyrotechnic
artist, when we enjoyed our "fun" without any reference
to Protestant or Catholic proclivities. Few, except the
better educated, knew what the "Gunpowder Plot" really meant.
Some associated it mainly with our own pyrotechnic efforts and other
attendant consumption of the explosive compound, on the then
special occasion. I rather fancy the ancient November "Allhallow
fires" have in their decadence, merged into the modern "Gunpowder
Plot" bonfires; and hence the reason why, in some rural districts,
they yet abound, while they are fast disappearing from our more
populous towns. I was surprised to find, when riding on an omnibus
from Manchester for about five miles on the Bury-road, on the
evening of a recent anniversary of this "holiday," that I could count,
near and on the horizon, fires of this description by the dozen, and
yet, while in Manchester, I had remained ignorant of the fact that
bonfire associations were influencing the conduct of any section of
society. The merging of one superstition, custom, habit, or tradition,
into another, is one of the most ordinary facts of history.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Edwards, in his "Land's End District," gives a very
graphic account of the bonfires lighted up in Cornwall on <i>Midsummer
eve</i>. Some of the details sufficiently resemble those of our
northern "gunpowder plot" demonstrations to prove that a Guy
Fawkes and an Act of Parliament are not absolutely necessary to
make a bonfire festivity attractive to the descendants of the fire-worshippers
of old. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On these eves a line of tar barrels, relieved occasionally by
large bonfires, is seen in the centre of each of the principal streets in
Penzance. On either side of this line, young men and women pass
up and down, swinging round their heads heavy torches made of large
pieces of folded canvas steeped in tar, and nailed to the ends of sticks
between three and four feet long; the flames of some of these almost
equal those of the tar barrels. Rows of lighted candles, also, when
the air is calm, are fixed outside the windows or along the sides of
the streets. In St. Just and other mining parishes, the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
miners, mimicking their father's employments, bore rows of holes in
the rocks, load them with gunpowder, and explode them in rapid
succession by trains of the same substance. As the holes are not
deep enough to split the rocks, the same little batteries serve for
many years.... In the early part of the evening, children
may be seen wreathing wreaths of flowers,&mdash;a custom in all probability
originating from the ancient use of these ornaments when they
danced around the fires. At the close of the fireworks in Penzance,
a great number of persons of both sexes, chiefly from the neighbourhood
of the quay, used always, until within the last few years, to join
hand in hand, forming a long string, and run through the streets,
playing 'thread the needle,' heedless of the fireworks showered upon
them, and ofttimes leaping over the yet glowing embers. I have, on
these occasions, seen boys following one another, jumping through
flames higher than themselves. But while this is now done innocently,
in every sense of the word, we all know that the passing
of children through fire was a very common act of idolatry; and the
heathen believed that all persons, and all living things, submitted to
this ordeal, would be preserved from evil throughout the year."</p>

<p>I remember well the bonfire processions during election periods,
at Preston, above forty years ago, in the palmy days of the late
Mr. Henry Hunt. It is not improbable that a remnant of the old
superstition hovered about them; and that a latent belief in the
"luck-bringing" qualities of fire, to a slight extent, influenced their
promoters.</p>

<p>A few years ago I visited, in company with Mr. Thornber, a field
at Hardhorn, near Poulton, and was shown by that gentleman some
of the stones yet remaining of what he has for many years regarded
as the remains of a very ancient Teanlea cairn. Some of the stones
bore marks of fire. The mound must, however, have been neglected
for a length of time, inasmuch as the shrewd old farmer who had
destroyed it had no recollection or traditionary knowledge respecting
the use to which it had been appropriated. But from the ashes and
other indications of fire which the upper portion of the cairn presented,
the worthy husbandman felt confident that "it hed bin a
blacksmith's forge i' th' olden time."</p>

<p>Godfrey Higgins in his "Celtic Druids," asserts, on the authority
of Hayman Rooke, that "so late as the year 1786, the custom of
lighting fires was continued at the Druid temple at Bramham, near
Harrowgate, Yorkshire, on the eve of the summer solstice." The
Bramham crags referred to present a singularly curious specimen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
partial disintegration of huge rocks belonging to the millstone grit
series. Their present peculiar forms are not now attributed by the
learned to human agency, in any marked degree at least, but to
the denuding action of water, frost, and other geological conditions
or phenomena. Nevertheless, from the wild and even weird aspect
of the group and its elevated site, it is by no means improbable that it
has been used in early times as a place of worship, or as the locality
for the performance of superstitious rites of the class referred to.
Doubtless, other localities of a similar character might be pointed out.
"Beacon Fell," near "Parlick Pike," and the "Tandle Hills," near
Rochdale, may have been used as places of public assembly, and for
the performance of similar superstitious observances. The same may
be said of Ingleborough, which yet exhibits remains of Keltic occupation.</p>

<p>This fire-worship, amongst a barbarous people, appears to have had
by no means a strange or unnatural origin. Mr. Walter Kelly, after
a very elaborate analysis, concludes that the Prometheus of the
Greeks and the Vedic M&acirc;tarisvan are "essentially the same." "The
elder fire-gods, Agni and Rudra," he says, "had a troop of fire-kindling
attendants, called Pramathas or Pram&acirc;thas," and he regards
Prometheus as the Greek form of this word. He calls attention to
the fact that Diodorus says of the celebrated Titan, that "according
to the mythographers he stole fire from the gods, but that in reality
he was the inventor of the fire-making instrument." The discoverer
of the chark, or "fire-drill," an instrument for obtaining fire by artificial
means, would be so great a benefactor to a people that had to
suffer all the inconveniences resulting from occasional fireless hearths,
that we may well understand why he should be invested by his
astonished and delighted fellow-savages with miraculous or supernatural
powers.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Doubtless the production of fire by the rubbing
together of two pieces of dry timber preceded this discovery, but, under
many circumstances, the operation must have been a most laborious
one, and ofttimes impracticable. But with the "chark" the result
was nearly as certain as when flint, steel, and tinder were employed
for this purpose. It was a very simple instrument indeed, but it has
nevertheless exercised a marvellous influence on the destinies of mankind.
It consisted merely of a piece of soft dry wood with a hole drilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in its centre, into which a rod of hard wood, ash, or oak, was placed,
and caused to revolve with rapidity by a cord, passed round it, being
pulled and slackened at each end alternately. A wheel and its axle
have hence become types of the sun and the thunderbolt. Fire produced
in this original way was considered sacred. Even the Greeks and
Romans, as well as the Kelts, and some Christian populations until
recent times, adopted the same or a similar process in the lighting of
fires connected with religious ceremonies. Mr. Kelly says "the
Church has not quite yet succeeded in effacing the vestiges of their
heathen origin. This is especially evident in the usages of many districts,
where the purity of the Easter fire (an idea borrowed from Pagan
tradition) is secured by deriving the kindling flame either from the
consecrated Easter candles, or from the new-born and perfectly pure
element produced by the priest from flint and steel." The Vedic
chark was made from the wood of two sacred trees; "the sami sprang
from heavenly fire sent down to earth, and the asvattha from the
vessel which contained it." Kelly adds:&mdash;"The idea of marriage,
suggested by such a union of the two trees, is also developed in the
Veda with great amplitude and minuteness of detail, and is a very
prominent element in the whole cycle of myths connected with the
chark." Doubtless, we have here exposed the root of the entire system
of phallic worship, stripped of much, if not all, of the grossness
afterwards attendant upon it. It appears that amongst the Peruvians,
who were sun-worshippers, the great national festival was held at the
summer solstice. They collected the rays of that luminary in a concave
mirror, by which means they rekindled their fires. Sometimes,
indeed, they obtained their "need-fire" by friction of wood. Amongst
the Mexicans likewise grand religious celebrations took place at the
close of the fifty-second year, when the extinguished fires were
rekindled "by the friction of sticks." This is a very general practice
amongst savage tribes at the present day. Mr. Angus says some of
the western tribes of Australia "have no means of kindling fire.
They say that it formerly came from the north." Should that of
one tribe unfortunately become extinguished, there was nothing for it
but journeying to a neighbouring encampment and borrowing a light.
The Tasmanians are in the same predicament. The Fegeeans obtain
fire by friction. So do other South Sea Islanders, as well as many of
the North American Indians. The Dacotahs and Iroquois use an
instrument not unlike the drilling bow at present employed for a
certain class of work in Europe. According to Father Gabian, fire
was utterly unknown to the natives of the Ladrone Islands "till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Magellan, provoked by their repeated thefts, burned one of their
villages. When they saw their wooden houses blazing, they first
thought the fire a beast which fed upon wood, and some of them, who
came too near, being burnt, the rest stood afar off, lest they should
be devoured or poisoned by this powerful animal."</p>

<p>The practice of kindling original or "need-fire" from a superstitious
reverence of its sacred character, is yet very common in
various parts of Germany, Scotland, and Ireland, and even in
England. Mr. Kemble quotes, from the Lanercost Chronicle, of
the year 1268, a denunciation by the pious writer, of a practice
which "certain bestial persons, monks in garb but not in mind,"
had taught the ignorant peasantry. This practice consisted in the
extraction of fire from wood by friction, and the setting up of what
he styles a "simulacrum Priapi," with a view to protect their cattle
from disease. This image of Priapus is supposed to refer to the
sun-god Fro or Fricco, who, according to Wolf, was worshipped until
a very recent period in Belgium, under the form of Priapus. Priapus,
the god of gardens or fertility, was the son of Bacchus and Venus.
In the more mountainous portions of Wales a remnant of evidently
heathen image-worship, of a somewhat similar character, survived till
relatively modern times. In the reign of Henry the Eighth, an idol,
or what old Fuller calls "a great lubberly image," was removed from
the diocese of St. Asaph, and publicly burnt in Smithfield. This
image was known by the name of "Darvell Gatheron;" and it
was said that the country people were in the habit of sacrificing
oxen and sheep to it. Hence its condemnation by the church
authorities.</p>

<p>Grimm refers to a remarkable instance of this superstition, which
occurred in the island of Mull as recently as 1767, which vividly
illustrates the "toughness" of tradition, as Dasent expresses it. He
says:&mdash;"In consequence of a disease amongst the black cattle, the
people agreed to perform an incantation, though they esteemed it a
wicked thing. They carried to the top of Carnmoor a wheel and
nine spindles, long enough to produce fire by friction. If the fire
were not produced before noon, the incantation lost its effect. They
failed for several days running. They attributed this failure to the
obstinacy of one householder, who would not let his fires be put out for
what he considered so wrong a purpose. However, by bribing his
servants, they contrived to have them extinguished, and on that
morning raised their fire. They then sacrificed a heifer, cutting in
pieces and burning, while yet alive, the diseased part. They then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lighted their own hearths from the pile, and ended by feasting on the
remains. Words of incantation were repeated by an old man from
Morven, who came as the master of the ceremonies, and who continued
speaking all the time the fire was being raised. This man was
living a beggar at Bellochroy. Asked to repeat the spell, he said the
sin of repeating it once had brought him to beggary, and that he
dared not say those words again." Many other instances might be
cited in Scotland and Ireland: but the one most to the present
purpose is related by Mr. T. T. Wilkinson, in which a Lancashire
man "unconsciously resorted to the old worship of Baal, and consumed
a live calf in a fire, in order to counteract the influences of his
unknown enemies." This individual was well known to Mr. Wilkinson.
He firmly believed that witchcraft was at the root of all his
troubles, and that his cattle had died in consequence of its spells.
It appears he had previously tried the famous Lancashire expedient
to render his stables and shippons proof against his supernatural
enemies&mdash;the nailing of horseshoes on all his doors&mdash;without obtaining
the desired result; so, in desperation, knowing the tradition, he
sacrificed a living calf to the fire-god Bel!</p>

<p>The following paragraph appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, on the
29th of June, 1867:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The accounts given by the Irish newspapers of the extent to
which the old superstition of fire-lighting on Midsummer eve still
prevails show how slowly the relics of Paganism disappear among
country people, and how natural it was that the old idolatries should
come at last to be known as the creed of the 'Pagana,' the dwellers
in villages. These Midsummer fires, lighted annually on the hills,
are simply relics of the worship of Bel. Beltane-day, or Belteine,
is still a May-day as well as a Midsummer festival in the more
ignorant districts of Scotland as well as of Ireland, and similar superstitious
practices are connected with the lighting of the fires; and,
what is still more remarkable, the word is still used in some Scotch
almanacs as a term well-known to everybody. In a number of the
<i>Scotsman</i> a few years ago appeared the announcement that 'On
Beltane-day Mr. Robertson was elected convener of the Trades of
Cannongate in Edinburgh.' The next year the following is to be
found:&mdash;'On Beltane-day the weavers, dyers, etc., of the Cannongate
re-elected their office bearers.'"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>The records of the Presbytery of Dingwall show that as recently
as the latter portion of the seventeenth century, on the island of
Innis Maree, in Loch Maree, bulls were offered up as a sacrifice, and
milk offered on the hill sides as a libation. In the year 1678, the
Presbytery took action against some of the Mackenzie family, "for
sacrificing a bull in a heathenish manner, in the island of St. Rufus,
for the recovery of the health of Cirstane Mackenzie, who was
formerly sick and valetudinarie." Mr. Henderson, in his "Folk-Lore
of the Northern Counties," mentions an instance, "within
fifteen years ago," of "a herd of cattle, in that county (Moray) being
attacked with fever," when, "one of them was sacrificed by burning
alive, as a propitiatory offering for the rest."</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hunt, in his "Drolls, Traditions, and Superstitions of
Old Cornwall," published in 1865, says that he has been informed
"that within the last few years a calf has been thus sacrificed by a
farmer in a district where churches, chapels, and schools abound."
He afterwards adds:&mdash;"While correcting these sheets I am informed
of two recent instances of this superstition. One of them was the
sacrifice of a calf by a farmer near Pontreath, for the purpose of removing
a disease which had long followed his horses and cows. The
other was the burning of a living lamb, to save, as the farmer said,
'his flocks from spells which had been cast on 'em.'"</p>

<p>The Midsummer fires, at the vigil of St. John the Baptist, and the
yule log ceremonies at Christmas, may be referred to a similar origin.
Brand says:&mdash;"The Pagan rites of this festival (Midsummer Eve)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at the summer solstice may be considered as a counterpart of those
used at the winter solstice at Yule-tide." The wheel, the type of the
sun, was common to both festivities. Darand describes the practice,
at the feast of St. John, of rolling about a wheel, "to signify that
the sun, then occupying the highest place in the zodiac, was beginning
to descend." The old poet, Naogeorgus, describes the wheel
as being covered with straw, which was set on fire at the top of a
high mountain, and then despatched on its downward course. He
adds that the people imagined all their ill luck accompanied the
wheel in its descent.</p>

<p>The writer of the old homily <i>De Festo Sancti Johannis Baptist&aelig;</i>,
when referring to these observances, speaks of three fires being
kindled, one of which was called "a Bone fire; another is clene
woode and no bones, and that is called a Wode fire, for people to sit
and wake thereby; the third is made of wode and bones, and is
called Saynt Johanny's Fyre.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The first fyre, as a great clerke,
Johan Belleth, telleth he saw in a certayne countrey, so in the
countrey there was soo greate hete the which causid that dragons
to go together in tokenynge that Johan dyed in brennynge
love and charyt&eacute; of God and man.... Then as these dragons
flewe in th' ayre, they shed down to the water froth of ther Kynde,
and so envenymed the waters, and caused moche people for to take
theyr deth thereby, and many dyverse sykenesse. Wyse clerkes
knoweth well that dragons hate nothyng more than the stenche of
brennynge bones, and therefore they gaderyd as many as they mighte
fynde, and brent them; and so with the stenche thereof they drove
away the dragons, and so they were brought out of greete dysease."</p>

<p>Brand regards this as a "pleasant piece of absurdity;" but it appears
that the quaint old writer, after all, is but relating that which
was believed to be true in his own age, and which after-gained knowledge
enables us to distinguish as a remnant of the old Aryan superstition
or myth, in a medi&aelig;val dress. These rolling fiery wheels,
burning brands, bonfires, and processions round fields, &amp;c., are common
to both the Keltic and Teutonic branches of the Aryan race, and
have evidently a similar origin. Kemble quotes an ancient Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
MS., which he found among the Harleian collection, which gives a
precisely similar description of the St. John's fires. It is not improbable
that it may have been written by the "learned clerke Johan
Belleth," to whom the writer of the homily refers. Walter Kelly,
speaking of it says, "Here we have again the primitive Aryan dragon
Ahi, at his old work in the sultry midsummer weather." He contends
that all the details referred to, as attendant on the St. John's
fires, have been demonstrated by Dr. Kuhn to be "in striking accordance
with the Vedic legend of Indra's fight with the midsummer
demons. The passage quoted by Kemble, besides stating expressly
that the course of the blazing wheel was meant to represent the descent
of the sun from its solstitial height, brings the St. John's fires
in immediate connection with the dragons that poison the waters,
just as did the demon Vritra, otherwise called Ahi, the dragon. He
possessed himself of the sun-wheel and the treasures of Heaven,
seized the (white) women, kept them prisoners in his cavern, and laid
a curse on the waters, until Indra released the captives and took off
the curse. The same conception is repeated in countless legends of
mountains that open on St. John's day, when the imprisoned white
women come forth, and the hour approaches in which the spell laid
upon them and upon the buried treasures will be broken....
Here we see at once that the German" (and Keltic) "custom was
nothing else than a dramatic representation of the great elemental
battle portrayed in the sacred books of the southern Aryans. In the
one the blazing wheel stands on the top of the hill, in the other the
sun stands on the summit of the cloud mountain. Both descend
from their heights, and both are extinguished, the sun in the cloud
sea, behind the cloud mountain, the wheel in the river at the foot of
the hill." One name given to a combatant on the dragon's side is
Kuyava, which is interpreted the "harvest spoiler, or the spoiled
harvest." The following passage in the Rig Veda is uttered by Indra,
when he resolves to destroy the monster,&mdash;"Friend Vishnu, stride
vastly; sky give room for the thunderbolt to strike; let us slay
Vritra and let loose the waters." His worshippers likewise exclaim,&mdash;"When,
thunderer, thou didst by thy might slay Vritra, who stopped
up the streams, then thy dear steeds grew."</p>

<p>The Rev. G. W. Cox says:&mdash;"The Nemean lion is the offspring of
Typhon, Orthros, or Echidna; in other words it is sprung from
Vritra, the dark thief, and Ahi, the throttling snake of darkness, and
it is as surely slain by Heracles as the snakes which had assaulted
him in his cradle. Another child of the same horrid parents is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Lernaian Hydra, its very name denoting a monster who, like the
Sphinx or the Panis, shuts up the waters and causes drought. It
has many heads, one being immortal, as the storm must constantly
supply new clouds, while the vapours are driven off by the sun into
space. Hence the story went that although Heracles could burn
away its mortal heads, as the sun burns up the clouds, still he can
but hide away the mist or vapour itself, which at its appointed time
must again darken the sky."</p>

<p>Dr. Kuhn contends that the clothing of wheels with straw and the
extinguishing of them when set on fire by immersion in a river, as is
done in the vine-growing districts of Germany, with the view to
secure a good harvest, is to be referred to this source. In support of
his view, he enters into an elaborate philological argument to show
that <i>yava</i> must have originally meant grass in general, afterwards
cereal grasses, and that its root gave birth to the name of the grain
from which the oldest bread-stuff known was made. He says&mdash;"But
I go still further, and I believe that <i>Kuyava</i> was also regarded as the
spoiler of vegetation in general, who parched up the plants used in
making the fermented liquor, soma, and amongst these plants the
Hindus included <i>yava</i>, which, in this case, meant barley or rice. It
will be seen in the sequel that the demon possesses himself also of the
heavenly soma (the moisture of the clouds), that he is robbed of it by
Indra, and that the like conception is found also among the Greeks
and the Germans. This, then, sufficiently explains the hope of a
good wine year, which was associated with the victory in the above-described
German customs."</p>

<p>The Venerable Bede, in his treatise on the "Nature of Things,"
gives us what may be termed the scientific view respecting rain and
lightning which obtained about his time. It is singularly in accordance
with Dr. Kuhn's interpretation of the myth now under consideration.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lightning is produced by the rubbing together of clouds, after
the manner of flints struck together, the thunder occurring at the
same time, but sound reaches the ears more slowly than light the
eyes. For all things the collision creates fire. Some say that while
air draws water in vapour from the depths, it draws also fire heat-wise,
and by their contact the horrid crash of thunder is produced;
and <i>if the fire conquer, it will be injurious to fruits; if water beneficial</i>;
but that the fire of lightning has so much the more penetrative power,
from being made of subtler elements than that which is in use
by us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>It is merely necessary that the rhetorical figure, personification, be
freely applied to this passage, with due reverence towards the ancient
superstitions, and the mythic element which lies at the root of these
singular customs is reproduced.</p>

<p>It is evident the whole have reference to the influence of the burning
heat of the midsummer sun, which induces long droughts, and
parches the soil and the vegetation; and to the delight engendered
when that heat is mitigated, and the scorched earth is again rendered
fruitful by copious showers, the product of the thunderstorm. And
to this source, Mr. Kelly justly contends, may be referred all the
supernatural dragon stories of our nurseries, whether fought "by
Pagan or Christian champions, from Apollo, Hercules, and Siegfried,
down to St. George, and to that modern worthy More, of Morehall,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who slew the dragon of Wantley."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The learned Pettingall has shown that the dragon slain by the
English champion and patron, St. George, was, by the ancient
Orientals, engraved on amulets, and that it was intended to symbolise
the virtues of Mithras, the sun. He says, "From the Pagans the
use of these charms passed to the Basilidians, and in their Abraxas,
the traces of the antient Mithras and the more modern St. George,
are equally visible. In the dark ages, the Christians borrowed their
superstitions from the heretics, but they disguised the origin of them,
and transformed into the saint the sun of the Persians and the archangel
of the Gnostics."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Wilson, when speaking of the art examples pertaining to what
is termed, in Western Europe, the "Stone age," says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In no single case is any attempt made to imitate leaf or flower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bird, beast, or any simple, natural object; and when in the bronze
work of the later Iron period, imitative forms at length appear, they
are chiefly the snake and dragon shapes and patterns, borrowed
seemingly by Celtic and Teutonic wanderers, with the wild fancies of
their mythology, from the far Eastern cradle-land of their birth."</p>

<p>Marsden, in his "History of Sumatra," says that during an
eclipse, the natives make "a loud noise with sounding instruments,
to prevent one luminary from devouring the other, as the Chinese,
to frighten away the dragon, a superstition that has its source in the
ancient systems of astronomy (particularly the Hindu), where the
nodes of the moon are identified with the dragon's head and tail."</p>

<p>The dragon was the standard of the West Saxons, and of the
English previous to the Norman Conquest. It formed one of the
supporters of the Royal arms borne by all our Tudor monarchs, with
the exception of Queen Mary, who substituted the eagle. Several of
the Plantagenet kings and princes inscribed a figure of the dragon
on their banners and shields. Peter Langtoffe says, at the battle of
Lewis, fought in 1264:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 31em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The King (Henry III.) schewed forth his schild his Dragon full austere."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Another authority says the said king ordered to be made "a dragon
in the manner of a banner, of a certain red silk embroidered with
gold; its tongue like a flaming fire must always seem to be moving;
its eyes must be made of sapphire, or of some other stone suitable for
that purpose."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the transformations which several of them may
have undergone from relatively modern local influences, there can be
little doubt the fiery-dragon and the numerous huge-worm traditions of
the North of England enshrine relics of Aryan superstitions. Besides
the dragon Ahi, we have the Vedic great serpent Sesha, to which
reference has been made in the first chapter of this work. We find
the D&ecirc;vas, when at war with their enemies the Asuras, agreed to a truce
in order that they might "churn the ocean," and so procure some
soma or drink of the gods, or milk the heavenly cows (the clouds)
wherewith to slake their grievous thirst. They coiled this great
serpent around a hill or mountain in the sea, and used him as a rope
under whose action the hill spun rapidly round until the heavenly
liquor (rain water) was procured in sufficient quantity. The famous
Lambton worm, when coiled round a hill, was pacified with copious
draughts of milk, and his blood flowed freely when he was pierced
by the spear heads attached to the armour of the returned crusader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The Linton worm coiled itself round a hill, and by its poisonous
breath, destroyed the neighbouring animal and vegetable life. The
knight who destroyed it used burning pitch in the operation. The
contractions of this huge worm in dying, are said to have left indented
spiral lines on the sides of Warmington hill. The Pollard worm is
described as "a venomous serpent which did much harm to man and
beast," while that of Stockburn is designated as the "worm, <i>dragon,
or fiery flying serpent</i> which destroyed man, woman, and child."
These worms were said to have been slain by the spears or swords
of knights, evidently modern substitutes for the thunderbolt of
Indra, the ancient Aryan "god of the firmament." A <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
slain worm, however, seems from the records to have been a very
small affair in comparison with the gigantic monsters of the
Durham traditions. Towards the end of the seventeenth century,
a writer of the family history of the Somervilles, referring to
the worm which John Somerville slew, in the reign of William
the Lion, avers that it was "in length three Scots yards, and
somewhat bigger than an ordinary man's leg, with a head more
proportionable to its length than greatness, in form and colour like to
our common muir-edders." As the valour of Indra fertilised the
earth; so virtue of a similar quality in a high degree procured broad
lands for the earthly champion, from his grateful sovereign.</p>

<p>It is by no means improbable, if, as Mr. D. Haigh contends, in his
"Conquest of Britain by the Saxons," the scene of the fine old Anglo-Saxon
poem Beowulf, was near Hartlepool, in the county of Durham,
that these monster worm traditions of the north of England may be
the remains of the mythic superstitions therein embodied.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
giant and sprite Grendel, the "Ghost-slayer," and his equally
sanguinary mother, are evidently personifications of evil influences.
After Beowulf had despatched the male monster, he proceeded to the
pool, in the <i>depths of which</i> he successfully contended with the female.
As he and his followers sat in the deep shadow of the wood overhanging
the "<i>bottomless</i>" pool "they saw along the water many of
the <i>worm-kind</i>, strange <i>sea dragons</i>, also in clefts of the ness Nickers
lying." Professor Henry Morley, in his "English Writers," gives a
summary of the poem, the following passage in which demonstrates
the great antiquity of this superstition:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Afterward the broad land came under the sway of Beowulf. He
held it well for fifty winters, until in the dark nights a dragon, which
in a stone mound watched a hoard of gold and cups, won mastery.
It was a hoard heaped up in sin, its lords were long since dead; the
last earl, before dying, hid it in the earth-cave, and for three hundred
winters the <i>great scather</i> held the cave, until some man, finding by chance
a rich cup, took it to his lord. Then the den was searched while the worm
slept; again and again when the dragon awoke there had been theft.
He found not the man, but <i>wasted the whole land with fire</i>; nightly, the
<i>fiendish air-flyer made fire grow hateful</i> to the sight of men. Then it
was told to Beowulf.... He sought out the dragon's den and
fought with him in awful strife. One wound the poison-worm struck
in the flesh of Beowulf.... Then, while the warrior-king sat
deathsick on a stone, he sent his thanes to see the cups and dishes in
the den of the dread twilight-flyer.... He said, 'I for this
gold have wisely sold my life; let others care now for the people's
need. I may be here no longer.'"</p>

<p>Mr. John Mitchell Kemble, who published an amended prose translation
of Beowulf, in 1833, considered the poem to be founded upon
legends which existed anterior to the conquest of the northern part
of Britain by the Angles. Beowulf he regarded as the name of a god,
one of the ancestors of Woden, and who appears in the poem "as a
defender, a protecting and redeeming being." The hero belonged to
the tribe of Ge&aacute;ts or Goths. This word etymologists trace to the
Anglo-Saxon ge&oacute;tan and ge&aacute;t, which imply a pouring forth. One of
Odin's names amongst the gods, according to the Edda, was Gautr,
the god of abundance. The monster Grendel is thus described in the
English summary of the poem by Professor Henry Morley:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The grim guest was Grendel, he that held the moors, the fen,
and fastness. Forbidden the homes of mankind, the daughters of
Cain brought forth in darkness misshapen giants, elves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
orkens, such giants as long warred with God, and he was one of
these." The reference to the daughters of Cain would seem to suggest
an interpolation by a transcriber after the introduction of Christianity.</p>

<p>Geoffrey of Monmouth relates a story of a certain mythic King
of Northumbria named Morvidus, who was less fortunate than
Beowulf, inasmuch as he lost his life, and gained nothing for his
people by its sacrifice. But then, we are informed, he "was a most
cruel tyrant." It appears that the land north of the Humber was
invaded in great force by a king of the Moreni (near Boulogne). He
was defeated by Morvidus, who abused his victory by the most
monstrous acts of cruelty. Whilst thus engaged, Geoffrey informs
us that "there came from the coasts of the Irish Sea a most cruel
monster, that was continually devouring the people upon the sea
coasts. As soon as he heard of it, he ventured to go and encounter
it alone. When he had in vain spent all his darts upon it, the
monster rushed upon him, and with open jaws swallowed him up
like a small fish."</p>

<p>These dragon monsters are often found in connection with imprisoned
maidens, and treasures buried in caves or the inner recesses
of mountains. Some mythographers regard the maiden as a personification
of the dawn imprisoned by the darkness of the night, and
afterwards freed by the rays of the sun. In the Vedic myths, besides
Ahi, the throttling snake, and Vritra, the dragon, there is Pani, the
thief and seducer, who stole the cows of Indra from their heavenly
pastures, hid them in his dark cloud cave, and attempted to corrupt
Sarama (the dawn), when, at the bidding of the lightning-god, she
demanded the restoration of the plundered cattle. Max M&uuml;ller, the
Rev. G. W. Cox, and others, contend that these incidents underlie
most of the mythical epics of all the Aryan nations. They say
that the siege of Troy, even, "is a reflection of the daily siege
of the East by the solar powers that every evening are robbed of
their brightest treasures in the West."</p>

<p>The celebrated medi&aelig;val metrical romance, "Kyng Alisaunder,"
translated into English verse, in the thirteenth century, by an
unknown author, is a complete <i>repertoire</i> of these dragon, worm, and
monster superstitions. According to it, the hero was the son of a
magician who appeared to his mother in the form of a great dragon
of the air. At his birth "the earth shook, the sea became green, the
sun ceased to shine, the moon appeared and became black, the
thunder crashed." The original is said to have been written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Simeon Seth, keeper of the imperial wardrobe at Constantinople,
about the year 1060. It is founded on Oriental legends, and was
translated and enlarged into Latin and French before the English
version appeared. Many of its monstrosities are evidently degraded
forms of Grecian and other Aryan myths.</p>

<p>The celebrated prophecy of Merlin, in Geoffrey of Monmouth's
"History of Britain," is full of malignant dragons, white and red,
which fight furiously, and "cast forth fire with their breath." The
red dragon, in one instance, the prophet says, "shall return to his
proper manners, and turn his rage upon himself. Therefore shall
the <i>revenge of the Thunderer show itself, for every field shall disappoint the
husbandman</i>. Mortality shall snatch away the people, and make a
desolation over all countries."</p>

<p>Dragons, huge worms, and serpents appear frequently to be confounded
in Merlin's prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> One sentence reads thus: "She
shall be encompassed with the adder of Lincoln, who with a horrible
hiss shall give notice of his presence to a multitude of dragons. Then
shall the dragons encounter and tear one another to pieces. The
winged shall oppress that which wants wings, and fasten its claws
into the poisonous cheeks." In another instance, the Aryan dragon,
or harvest destroyer, is very apparent. Merlin says:&mdash;"To him shall
succeed a husbandman of Albania, at whose back shall be a serpent.
He shall be employed in ploughing the ground, that the country may
become white with corn. <i>The serpent shall endeavour to diffuse his poison,
in order to blast the harvest.</i>" Again he says:&mdash;"There shall be a miserable
desolation of the kingdom, and the floors of the harvests shall
return to the fruitful forests. The white dragon shall rise again, and
invite over a daughter of Germany. Our gardens shall be again
replenished with foreign seed, and the red one shall pine away at the
end of the pond. After that shall the German worm be crowned, and
the brazen prince buried." Merlin's red and white dragons are
intended directly to personify the British and Saxon races of men, as
the red and white roses in after time served as emblems of the houses
of Lancaster and York; but the origin of the mythic form of expression
is very apparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>The <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> contains a paragraph under the date 793,
which illustrates the power of this superstition in the North of
England at that period. The passage itself likewise supplies sufficient
evidence to connect its interpretation with the Aryan myth under
consideration. We read: "A. 793. This year dire forewarnings came
over the land of the North-humbrians, and miserably terrified the
people; these were excessive whirlwinds and <i>lightnings</i>; and <i>fiery
dragons</i> were seen flying in the air. <i>A great famine soon followed these
tokens.</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Baring-Gould says,&mdash;"In a Slovakian legend the dragon
sleeps in a mountain cave through the winter months, but at the
equinox bursts forth. 'In a moment the heaven was darkened and
became black as pitch, only illumined by the fire which flashed from
the dragon's jaws and eyes. The earth shuddered, the stones rattled
down the mountain sides into the glens; right and left, left and right,
did the dragon lash his tail, overthrowing pines and bushes, and
snapping them as reeds. He evacuated such floods of water that the
mountain torrents were full. But after a while his power was exhausted;
he lashed no more with his tail, ejected no more water,
and spat no more fire.'" Mr. Gould adds,&mdash;"I think it impossible
not to see in this description a spring-tide thunderstorm."</p>

<p>The following paragraph, published in the <i>Calcutta Englishman</i> last
year (1871), demonstrates that this class of superstition still lingers
in India:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">An Astronomical Prediction.</span>&mdash;The <i>Urdu Akhbar</i> says that Maulvi
Mohammed Salimuz-yaman, the famous astronomer of Rampur,
whose deductions have generally turned out right, has foretold that
in the coming year (1872) a blaze of light resembling a shooting star, the
like of which no mortal has yet seen, will be visible in the sky. 'It
will dazzle the eyes of the people of particular places with lustre, and,
after remaining for a <i>ghari</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, 24 minutes), will vanish. The direction
in which it will make its appearance will be the North Pole, and
accordingly the people of northern countries will see it distinctly.
Probably the natives of China and Persia will likewise have a sight of
it. The effect of this meteor will be that the extent of the globe over
which its light will fall will be visited by famine during the year, and
a large number of the people inhabiting it will be destroyed, while
vegetation will be also scanty.'"</p>

<p>Veritable comets appear to have at times been confounded with
these fiery dragons. On the death of Aurelius Ambrosius, brother to
Uther, father of the renowned Arthur, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
"there appeared a star of wonderful magnitude and brightness,
darting forth a ray, at the end of which was a globe of fire, in
form of a dragon, out of whose mouth issued two rays, one of which
seemed to stretch out itself beyond the extent of Gaul, the other
towards the Irish sea, and ended in seven lesser rays."</p>

<p>Geoffrey further informs us that, after Uther's first great victory,
"remembering the explanation which Merlin had made of the star
above mentioned, he commanded two dragons to be made of gold, in
likeness of the dragon which he had seen at the ray of the star. As
soon as they were finished, which was done with wonderful nicety of
workmanship, he made a present of one to the cathedral church of
Winchester, but reserved the other for himself to be carried along with
him to his wars. From this time, therefore, he was called Uther
Pendragon, which, in the British tongue, signifies the dragon's head;
the occasion of this appellation being Merlin's prediction, from the
appearance of the dragon, that he should be king." The same
"historical" romancer likewise informs us that the redoubtable Arthur
himself, after he had embarked at Southampton, on his expedition
against Rome, about midnight, during a brisk gale, in a dream, "saw
a bear flying in the air, at the noise of which all the shores trembled;
also a terrible dragon flying from the west, which enlightened the
country with the brightness of its eyes. When these two met they
began a dreadful fight; but the dragon, with its fiery breath, burned
the bear which often assaulted him, and threw him down scorched to
the ground." This, of course, was interpreted to augur Arthur's
victory over the Emperor. Singularly enough, as has been before
observed, we find, in authentic history, that the "Golden Dragon" was
the standard of the <i>Saxon</i> kings of Wessex. When Cuthred defeated
"Ethelbald the Proud," King of Mercia, at Beorgforda (Burford, in
Oxfordshire), in 752, "the golden dragon, the ensign of Wessex," was
borne by his general, Ethelhun, termed "the presumptuous alderman,"
owing to a previous unsuccessful act of rebellion.</p>

<p>Dragon superstitions appear to have been earnestly believed by
medi&aelig;val alchemists, and even early chemists and physicians. An
old German work on alchemy (1625) informs us, as "a great wonder
and very strange," that the dragon contains the greatest "medicament,"
and that "there is a dragon lives in the forest who has no
want of poison; when he sees the sun or fire he spits venom, which
flies about fearfully. No living animal can be cured of it; even the
basilisk does not equal him. He who can properly kill this serpent
has overcome all his danger. His colours increase in death; physic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is produced from his poison, which he entirely consumes, and eats
his own venomous tail. This must be accomplished by him, in order
to produce the noblest balm. Such great virtue as we will point out
herein that all the learned shall rejoice."</p>

<p>The poison spitted out on sight of the sun or fire is evidently
analogous to the breath of the Aryan dragon Ahi, who scorched the
earth. The conqueror of the said dragon takes the place of Indra,
who, by discharging his lightning spear into the rain cloud, subdues
the monster, and converts his poison (excessive heat), into a medicine
or balm, which aids in the fertilisation of the earth.</p>

<p>This is in accordance with the Greek legend, which asserted that
&AElig;sculapius or Askl&ecirc;pios, the god of medicine, "wrought his wonderful
cures through the blood of Gorgo." Hence the serpent became his
symbol. At Epidaurus the god was supposed to manifest himself in
the form of a yellowish brown snake, abundant in that neighbourhood.
It frequented the temple, was large in size, but harmless and easily
tamed. The Rev. G. W. Cox, says, "throughout Hellas, Askl&ecirc;pios
remained the healer and restorer of life, and accordingly the serpent
is everywhere his special emblem, as the mythology of the Linga
would lead us to expect." Again he says, "the symbol of the
Phallos in its physical characteristics suggested the form of the
serpent, which thus became the emblem of life and healing, and as
such appears by the side of the Hellenic Askl&ecirc;pios, and in the
brazen crucified serpent venerated by the Jewish people until it was
destroyed by Hezekiah."</p>

<p>According to the Edda, the Scandinavians believed that after the
various gods had, for a considerable time, alternately overthrown
each other, the "fiery snake" would consume "universal nature
with all-destroying flames." The word "Edda" means "Mother of
Poetry." The contents of the Edda have been styled "half oriental
and half northern."</p>

<p>Remains of ancient serpent worship have been recently discovered
in America and in Scotland. Some writers indeed regard the temples
at Abury and Stonehenge as belonging to this class. One in North
America, described by Mr. Squier, is a mound 700 feet long, fashioned
in the form of a serpent. At the recent meeting of the British Association
in Edinburgh, Mr. John S. Phen&eacute;, F.G.S., described a mound of
this character, which he had discovered in Argyleshire. A large cairn
forms the head of the monster, which is 300 feet in length. The spinal
column, with its sinuous windings, is distinctly marked out by carefully
adjusted stones, now covered with peat. To detect the exact form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
entire reptile, it is necessary that the whole should be seen at one view
from above. A megalithic chamber was found beneath the head of the
serpent, or saurian, which contained burnt earth and bones, charcoal,
and charred nutshells, and a flint implement with the edge serrated
like a saw. The mound is described as being in a remarkably perfect
condition, considering its great antiquity.</p>

<p>Some writers, and notably one, some years ago in "Chambers's
Journal," discoursing on dragon superstitions, have suggested, as remains
of the traditionary Moa of New Zealand is still said to be found
in some portions of the islands, that our early ancestors may have had
a slight knowledge of the existence of some of the huge saurian reptiles,
known to us geologically in the fossil condition. This attempt
to give a naturalistic solution of the problem at first sight is very
plausible; but it falls to the ground at once, when the nature of
geological time is taken into consideration. The earliest remains of
man, including the flint implements in the higher river gravels, pertain
to what Lyell terms the post-pliocene period. The huge lizards or
saurians of the oolitic period had become extinct countless ages previously.
The same may be said, though in a relatively lesser degree, of
the huge Dinotherium found in the Upper Miocene formation. Some
writers, indeed, who advocate the hypothesis of man's descent by
"natural selection" or "evolution," from the lower animals, contend
that some antitype of humanity <i>may</i> have lived in the Miocene period,
but of this we have no evidence. The extinct gigantic animals, found
in connection with the oldest known remains of man, are pachyderms,
which in no way resemble, either in their habits, or by the most
strained metaphor, in their forms, the dragons and serpents of
the Aryan mythology or their modern descendants in British history
and tradition. The discovery of their bones has undoubtedly had
something to do with giants and other monsters of the mythic
class, of which more will be said in another chapter.</p>

</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Hallowe'en at Balmoral Castle.</span>&mdash;This time-honoured festival was duly celebrated
at Balmoral Castle on Saturday evening, in a manner not soon to be forgotten
by those who took part in the enjoyments of the evening. As the shades of evening
were closing in upon the Strath, numbers of torch-lights were observed approaching
the Castle, both from the cottages on the eastern portion of the estate and also those on
the west. The torches from the western side were probably the more numerous, and as
the different groups gathered together the effect was very fine. Both parties met in
front of the Castle, the torch-bearers numbering nearly one hundred. Along with
those bearing the torches were a great many people belonging to the neighbourhood.
Dancing was commenced by the torch-bearers dancing a "Huachan" in fine style, to
the lilting strains of Mr. Ross, the Queen's piper. The effect was greatly heightened
by the display of bright lights of various colours from the top of the staircase of the
Tower. After dancing for some time, the torch-bearers proceeded round the Castle
in martial order, and as they were proceeding down the granite staircase at the northwest
corner of the Castle, the procession presented a singularly beautiful and romantic
appearance. Having made the circuit of the Castle, the remainder of the torches were
thrown in a pile at the south-west corner, thus forming a large bonfire, which was
speedily augmented with other combustibles until it formed a burning mass of huge proportions,
round which dancing was spiritedly carried on. Her Majesty witnessed the
proceedings with apparent interest for some time, and the company enjoyed themselves
none the less heartily on that account. Mr. Begg, distiller, Lochnagar, had also a
splendid bonfire on Cairnbeg, round which merry groups danced torch in hand.</p></div>

may mean good fire, that is sacred fire, or bone-fire, as the old writer suggests; but I
am inclined to think <i>boon</i> fire is worth consideration, as the ceremonies and sacrifices
were performed in order to extract a boon, a gift, or favour from the god Bel. Free
service rendered by a tenant to his lord, as part of his tenure, was called boon work.
Dr. Hibbert Ware records an old saying in the north of England to the effect that
when a man has been working for nothing he has "been served like a boon-shearer."</p></div>

</p><p>
<i>An Apology for Fire Worship.</i>&mdash;Tuesday, the 21st March, 1866, being the entrance
of Sol into the zodiacal sign of the Ram, there was held at the Persian Embassy,
Avenue d'Autin, Paris, the festival of Nourous Sultaniez, or New Year's Day of the
Shah. His Excellency Hassan Ali Khan presided over a large assemblage of distinguished
guests, and informed them in the course of the festivity that they were celebrating
a red-letter day as old as nineteen centuries before the birth of Christ, first instituted
by Djemchid, of the dynasty of Pischdadiens, who originated the solar computation
of years. His excellency proceeded to recall the fire-worship of his country,
which sprang from the prim&aelig;val idolatry having for object that great luminary. It
was still to fire that he fondly looked for the regeneration of Persia. Fire had changed
the face of Europe. With the steam engine, the railroad, the electric spark, the
screw or paddle ship, far more than in gunpowder or rifled cannon, fire was the great
benefactor that would bless one day the land of his forefathers, who had instinctively
worshipped that element in secret anticipation of what was to come. The remarks of
his excellency were cordially received.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Sir Bernard Burke says the legend asserts that the knight consulted a witch as to
the best method of attacking the monster serpent or dragon, as this worm is sometimes
styled. The witch duly instructed him, and he was victorious in the combat
which followed. A condition, however, was attached, namely that the knight should
follow up the achievement by slaying as a kind of sacrifice the first living thing he
met. If he failed in this, "for nine generations the lords of Lambton would never
die in their beds." It was intended that a dog should be placed so as to immediately
attract the eye of the conqueror, but unfortunately the plot was accidentally marred,
and the knight's father first confronted him. Lambton refused to fulfil the condition,
under such circumstances. It is stated to be a fact that afterwards nine successive
lords of Lambton died otherwise than in their beds.</p></div>

Hrothgar, chief or king of the Scyldings, at Hartlepool. King Oswy, brother and
successor of St. Oswald, consecrated his daughter Elfleda to the service of God as a
nun, as an act of thanksgiving for his victory over the pagan Mercian King Penda,
at Winwidfield, near Leeds (some say near Winwick, Lancashire.) Elfleda was
placed in the monastery called Herut-ed (Hartlepool), which is believed to be the
Heorot of the oldest Anglo-Saxon poem extant.</p></div>

Hence the confusion of traditionary worms, serpents, and dragons is not quite so
absurd as modern non-scientific persons generally imagine. The Rev. G. W. Cox,
referring to the Greek aspect of these mythic monsters, says:&mdash;"When the word
Dragon, which is only another form of Dorkas, the clear-eyed gazelle, became the
name for serpents, these mythical beings were necessarily transformed into snakes."</p></div>

</div><div class="rgt"><i>Eliza Cook.</i></div></div>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">If</span> there by any possibility existed a doubt that the religion of the
Messiah was one of <i>love</i> and not of <i>gloom</i>, the sunny side of the
argument would be amply vindicated by the fact that, from the
earliest Christian times, the anniversary of the advent of the Saviour
was always celebrated with becoming social enjoyment. "Merrie
Christmas," indeed, in spite of hail and rain, and sleet, and snow,
the blustering of old Boreas, and the frigid embrace of "Jack Frost,"
has passed into a proverb. The mass of the British people, notwithstanding
their characteristic constitutional phlegm, contrive to become
conspicuously social at Christmas tide. They appear to have
been too closely occupied with business affairs during the greater portion
of the year to indulge much in the hearty humour and frank
good-will which unquestionably form important elements in the
national idiosyncrasy. Their habitual taciturnity, however, influenced
by some law whose action is diametrically opposed to that which
determines the elemental routine, generally <i>thaws</i> on the approach of
Christmas. It is not too much to say that, at this period of the
year, the manly generous side of the English character is seen to
most advantage. Under the genial influence of Christmas associations,
even stern, plodding "men of business" leave their well-worn
official stools and well-thumbed ledgers, and enjoy heartily the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Christmas meal of roast beef and plum pudding in company with
their relatives and friends. Nay, at this festive season, we have seen
the veriest old "money-grubbers" of the city, the most cool and calculating
of the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the stock-exchange, dance and frolic, and
aid the juveniles of their social circles in the perpetration of practical
Christmas jokes, the compounding of "snap-dragon," the fashioning
of mistletoe bushes, etc., to the infinite delight of the youngsters and
their own evident personal gratification. There is, undoubtedly, a
time and a season for all things; and the British public especially
appear for ages to have resolved that "Christmas time" is the
season for the exercise of grateful memories, for the interchange of
social loudness, the propagation of the great principle of progressive
civilisation, "peace and good-will to man,"&mdash;yes, and likewise, for
the temperate indulgence in harmless mirth, and hearty, jovial
laughter.</p>

<p>Christmas is the season in which pantomimes flourish. By the
bye, who ever heard of a pantomime that was not a "Christmas"
one? I am certain I would not myself,&mdash;and I feel certain the
most boisterous of the young imps who giggle themselves into a
frightful condition of side-ache and cheek-ache when witnessing the
tricks and jokes, stale or otherwise, of clown and pantaloon, and the
perpetually unfortunate policeman, would endorse the sentiment,&mdash;I
would not walk two streets' length, no, not two yards, to witness
the best pantomime in the world on Midsummer's eve! One would
as soon think of asking the cook, as a special mark of her personal
regard, to give us a turn or two on the spit, accompanied by a copious
basting with rancid butter! But it is quite a different affair on
Christmas Eve, or "boxing night." The pantomime is, in every
sense, unquestionably the property of "dear old Christmas," and
then, and then only, can its rollicking fun, farce, fancy, and fairy
marvels be thoroughly understood or enjoyed.</p>

<p>Pantomime, among the Greeks and Romans, as well as the Chinese,
Persians, and other Oriental peoples, was a dramatic performance, in
which action and gesticulation formed the most prominent features.
The modern <i>ballet</i> is, perhaps, its most legitimate descendant at the
present day. The name, however, is derived from two Greek words,
which signify mimicry or "imitation of everything." The modern pantomime,
therefore, with its universal hash of fun and frolic, of fairies
and fiends, deities and dragons, of ghosts, goblins, and giants, of burlesque
and ballet, painting and punning, of music and mountebanking,
responds most accurately to the classical etymon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the profuse but somewhat indiscriminate hospitality, and
some of the ruder of the Christmas games and ceremonies of our
medi&aelig;val ancestors, have declined or fallen into general disuse, the
anniversary of the advent of the founder of the national religion yet
remains the chief season set apart especially for genial social intercourse,
the gathering together of relatives and friends, the interchange
of mutual good-will, and of festive enjoyment.</p>

<p>After discussing the various opinions, facts, and conjectures advanced
by others respecting the origin of "yule logs" and Christmas
fires, Brand says: "However this may be, I am pretty confident that
the yule block will be found, in its first use, to have been only a
counterpart of the Midsummer fires, made within doors because of
the cold weather at this winter solstice, as those in the hot season at
the summer one, are kindled in the open air."</p>

<p>Precisely so; yet, as the Midsummer fires were not kindled for the
sake of the warmth they afforded, but as a kind of incantation or a
propitiatory sacrifice to the fire-god or the elements generally, if the
two had a common origin, we may reasonably expect to find a similar
principle or motive at the root of the Christmas observances. At the
summer solstice the sun's heat parched the earth and burnt the vegetation.
Hence the propitiatory ceremony of the fire worshippers.
At the winter solstice his feeble rays were insufficient to the requirements
of vegetable existence, and the severe cold added to the privations
of both and man and beast. Hence the existence of a corresponding
sentiment and corresponding ceremonial observances.</p>

<p>Brand further says: "On the night of this eve our ancestors were
wont to light up candles of <i>an uncommon size</i>, called Christmas
candles, and lay a log of wood upon the fire, called a yule-clog or
Christmas block, to illuminate the house, and, as it were, turn night
into day. This custom is, in some measure, still kept up in the
north of England."</p>

<p>The early Christians were, and the learned of more modern times
are, divided in opinion as to the precise day of the Nativity. The
feast of the Passover and that of the Tabernacles have each found
powerful advocates. According to St. Chrysostom, the primitive
Christians celebrated the Christmas and Epiphany feasts at one and
the same time. They were not separated till the council of Nice, in
the year 325. Amongst the Armenians, notwithstanding, the two
feasts were jointly celebrated till as recently as the thirteenth century.
It has been urged by some that, as shepherds were watching
their flocks by night in the open air, the birth of Christ could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
scarcely have occurred in the winter season. But so long as one
time was accepted by the universal Church, it appeared to be of little
moment which theory was adopted. Sir Isaac Newton, in his "Commentary
on the Prophecies of Daniel," accounts for the choice of the
25th December on the ground of its being the winter solstice. He
shows, likewise, that other feasts were originally fixed at the cardinal
points of the year. "The first calendars having been so arranged by
mathematicians at pleasure, without any ground in tradition, the
Christians afterwards took up what they found in the calendars."</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that this view of the question is correct,
and that many of the curious customs and ceremonies, which were
for centuries religiously observed throughout the land, and many of
which still linger about the holiday celebrations of remote districts,
have an origin older than Christianity itself. The most orthodox and
exemplary writers of the middle ages acknowledge this, and contend
that the practice of the early Christians of appropriating the festive
seasons of their heathen converts was productive of good results.</p>

<p>The testimony of Thomas Warmstry, whose now rare tract, entitled
"A Vindication of the Solemnity of the Nativity of Christ,"
was published in 1648, is strongly in favour of this view. He says:
"If it doth appeare that the time of this festival doth comply with
the time of the heathen's <i>Saturnalia</i>, this leaves no charge of impiety
upon it: for since things are best cured by their contraries, it was
both wisdom and piety in the ancient Christians (whose work it was
to convert the heathens from such as well as other superstitions and
miscarriages) to vindicate such times from the service of the devill,
by appointing them to the more solemne and especiall service of
God. The <i>blazes</i> are foolish and vain, not countenanced by the
church."</p>

<p>The "blazes" here referred to are evidently the yule logs and immense
candles, which the worthy pastor denounces with orthodox
precision. "Blazes" and "Pandemonium" are yet synonymous
terms, in vulgar mouths, in many parts of Lancashire. Some of
the ceremonies of this period, however, meet with his somewhat
qualified approval. He says: "<i>Christmas Kariles</i>, if they be such as
are fit for the time, and of holy and sober composures, and used with
Christian sobriety and piety, they are not unlawfull, and may be
profitable if they be sung with grace in the heart. <i>New Yeare's gifts</i>,
if performed without superstition, may be harmless provocations to
Christian love and mutuall testimonies thereof to good purpose, and
never the worse because the heathens have had them at the like
times."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>One important attribute of the Yule log resulted from the fact that
each succeeding brand received its kindling fire from the remains of
its predecessor; hence its supposed supernatural influences. Herrick
sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>With the last year's brand</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Light the new block</i>, and<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On your psaltries play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweet luck may<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come while the log is a <i>teending</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Etymologists have laboured hard to get at the root of the word
Yule; some of them, however, with but indifferent success. Brand
says:&mdash;"I have met with no word of which there are so many and
such different etymologies as this of Yule, of which there seems
nothing certain but that it means Christmas." Some writers, including
the venerable Bede, derive it from <i>hveol</i>, the Anglo-Saxon
form of our modern English word wheel, which, as I have already
shown, is one of the Aryan types of the sun. Bede, I think, assigns
the true meaning to the term when he says it is so named "because
of the return of the sun's annual course, after the winter solstice."
According to Mr. Davies (Cel. Res. p. 191), the god Bel or Beli was
called Hu. Mallet in his "Northern Antiquities," says:&mdash;"All
Celtic nations have been accustomed to the worship of the sun;
either as distinguished from Thor," (? Bel) "or as considered his
symbol. It was a custom that everywhere prevailed in ancient times
to celebrate a feast at the winter solstice, by which men testified their
joy at seeing this great luminary return again to this part of the
heavens. This was the greatest solemnity in the year. They called
it in many places <i>Yole</i> or <i>Yuul</i>, from the word <i>Hiaul</i> and <i>Houl</i>,
which, even at this day, signifies the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> in the languages of Bass-Britagne
and Cornwall."</p>

<p>Brand objects to this etymology, on the ground that it "is giving
a Celtic derivation of a Gothic word (two languages extremely different.)"
This objection, however, falls to the ground with the discovery
of the fact that both languages have a common origin, and
that the several races and their superstitions are but separate developments
of Aryan blood and Aryan mythology. In modern Welsh
<i>gwyl</i> means a festival or holiday, and this may be the true root of the
word <i>gule</i>, in the phrase "the <i>gule</i> of August," or Lammas-day.
But the Welsh <i>gwyl</i> may itself be derived from the same root as <i>yule</i>,
which, to our ears, now only signifies, as Brand says, "Christmas,"
or the festive season. <i>Heulo</i>, in modern Welsh, means to "shine as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the sun." In India the term <i>Huli</i> festival is applied to the ceremonies
attendant upon the sun's entering into the spring quarter
at the vernal equinox.</p>

<p>In ordinary life we meet with very few persons who are aware of the
fact that the practice of regarding the first of January as the commencement
of a new year is of very modern origin, in England, at
least. Prior to 1752, in most legal or official matters, and in private
records, the year commenced on the 25th of March. At this time an
Act of Parliament was passed which "directed that the legal year
which then commenced in some parts of this country in March, and
in others in January, should universally be deemed to begin on the
first of January." This will appear to many as a strange species of
legislation, savouring somewhat of the vanity and irreverence for
which Canute, the great Danish King of England, rebuked his courtiers,
when he ironically commanded the tide to cease flowing, lest,
forsooth, it should damp his royal shoe-leather. The commencement
of the year, as has been before observed, being not a fact in physics,
but a conventional or civil arrangement for human convenience, is
therefore a legitimate subject for legislative interference, with the
view to arrive at a uniformity of style, and so facilitate business
operations and the enquiries of historians and students of science.</p>

<p>The practice of celebrating the new year's advent on the first of
January appears to have obtained to a considerable extent in England
long prior to its legal recognition. The famous Puritan writer,
Prynne, in his "Histrio-Mastrix, or a Scourge for Stage Players,"
published in 1632, has the following slashing tirade against the festive
observances of this period:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we now parallel our grand disorderly Christmases with these
Roman Saturnals and heathen festivals, or our New Yeare's Day (a
chiefe part of Christmas), with their festivity of Janus, which was
spent in mummeries, stageplays, dancing, and such like enterludes,
wherein fidlers and others acted lascivious effeminate parts, and
went about their towns and cities in women's apparel; whence the
whole Catholicke Church (as Alchuvinus and others write), appointed
a solemn publike faste upon this our New Yeare's day (which fast it
seems is now forgotten), to bewail these heathenish enterludes, sports,
and lewd idolatrous practices which have been used on it; <i>prohibiting
all Christians, under pain of excommunication, from observing the calends,
or first of January (which we now call New Yeare's Day), as holy, and
from sending abroad New Yeare's Gifts upon it (a custom now too frequent),
it being a mere relique of paganisme and idolatry, derived from the heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Romans' feast of two-faced Janus</i>, and a practice so execrable unto
Christians that not only the whole Catholicke Church, but even four
famous Councils" [and an enormous quantity of other authorities
which it is useless to quote] "have positively <i>prohibited the solemnization
of New Yeare's Day, and the sending abroad of New Yeare's Gifts,
under an anathema and excommunication</i>."</p>

<p>Although there can be no doubt that the practices referred to were
in existence prior to the introduction of Christianity, yet the threat of
excommunication and anathema failed to root them out of the heart
of the mass of the population, and they survive to the present day.
Some of the gifts made to sovereign princes on the advent of the new
year were not only valuable, but often quaint in device, and sometimes,
according to modern ideas, in singularly bad taste. The
accomplished scholar, soldier, and courtier, Sir Philip Sidney, on the
New Year's Day of 1578, presented to Queen Elizabeth a "cambric
chemise, its sleeves and collar wrought with black work and edged
with a small bone lace of gold and silver. With it was a pair of ruffs
interlaced with gold and silver, and set with spangles which alone
weighed four ounces." His friend Fulke Greville likewise presented
an embroidered chemise. On another occasion of a similar character,
(1581), "Sidney made three characteristic presents&mdash;a gold-handled
whip, a golden chain, a heart of gold, as though in token of his entire
subservience to her Majesty, and his complete surrender of himself to
the royal keeping." On one occasion, the Earl of Ormond presented
to the Queen "a golden ph&#339;nix, whose wings and feet glittered with
rubies and diamonds, and which rested on a branch covered with
other precious stones. Sir Christopher Hatton tendered a cross of
diamonds, furnished with a suitable motto; also a gold fancy,
imaging a dog leading a man over a bridge, and garnished with many
gems." Lord and Lady Cobham each presented a satin petticoat
elaborately ornamented. Her Majesty, on New Year's Day, it appears,
did not disdain to receive presents from her servants and
tradesmen. Nichols, in his "Royal Progresses," records that a
laundress solicited the Queen's acceptance of three pocket handkerchiefs
and a "tooth cloth." One domestic sought favour with a
linen and another with a cambric nightcap. Apothecaries presented
packets of green ginger, orange candy, and "that kind of stuff." A
butler's offering consisted of a meat knife, "with a bone handle and
a motto carved thereon," while the dustman tendered "two bolts of
cambric," the head gardener a silver-gilt porringer, with a "snail
sticking to an oak-leaf for handle," and the "sergeant of the pastry"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a "great quince pie with gilt ornaments." The Queen, in return,
presented her courtiers, etc., with "gilt plate, showing her esteem by
the quantity of the article" apportioned to each recipient. In his
preface Nichols remarks that "the only remains of this custom at
court now is that the two chaplains in waiting, on New Year's Day,
have each a crown piece laid under their plates at dinner."</p>

<p>Old Thomas Warmstry, as we have seen, held much milder language
on this subject than Prynne. He regarded the gifts as "harmless
provocations to Christian love, and mutual testimonies thereof to
good purpose," notwithstanding their heathen origin. The practice
is by no means extinct at the present time. In many towns shopkeepers
present their customers, on New Year's Day, with candles,
nutmegs, spices, etc., in token of good will.</p>

<p>Brand speaks of an ancient custom, which is yet retained in many
places on New Year's Eve: "Young women went about with a
Wassail Bowl of spiced ale, with some sort of verses that were sung
by them as they went from door to door." This liquor was sometimes
called "Lamb's Wool," although it is difficult to conjecture now
for what reason. In the "olden time" it appears to have been compounded
of ale, sugar, nutmeg, toast, and roasted apples or crabs.
The wassail bowl originally meant a health-drinking vessel, and is of
very ancient origin. The name is derived from two Anglo-Saxon
words <i>w&aelig;s h&aelig;l</i>, which signify "be in health," "wax (grow) in health,"
or in modern phrase, "good health."</p>

<p>Geoffrey of Monmouth refers to the Saxon practice of health drinking
on important occasions, when describing the visit of the British
King Vortigern to the palace of Hengist, the chieftain of the Teutonic
warriors then recently arrived in Britain. During the banquet,
Rowena, the beautiful daughter of Hengist, "came out of her chamber
bearing a golden cup of wine, with which she approached the
King, and making a low courtsey, said to him, 'Lanerd' (lord)
'King, wacht heil!' The King, at the sight of the lady's face, was
on a sudden both surprised and inflamed with her beauty, and, calling
to his interpreter, asked him what she said, and what answer he
should make her. 'She called you <i>Lord King</i>,' said the interpreter,
'and offered to drink your health. Your answer to her must be,
'<i>Drinc heil</i>!' Vortigern accordingly answered 'Drinc heil!' and
bade her drink; after which he took the cup from her hand, kissed
her, and drank himself. From that time to this it has been the
custom in Britain, that he who drinks to anyone says 'Wacht heil!'
and he that pledges him answers '<i>Drinc heil</i>?'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>In process of time, the practice of drinking healths on solemn or
festive occasions was confounded with ordinary tippling, and the term
wassail became applied indiscriminately to all festive intemperance.
Hamlet says, speaking of the drinking habits of the usurper,
Claudius&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The King doth wake to-night, and takes his rouse,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The triumph of his pledge.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Antiquarian Repertory (1775) contains a rude wood-cut of a
bowl carved on an oaken beam, which had formed a portion of an
ancient chimney recess. The vessel rests on the branches of an apple
tree, alluding perhaps, Sir Henry Ellis suggests, to "part of the
materials of which the liquor was composed." On one side the word
<i>Wass-heil</i> is inscribed, and on the other <i>Drinc-heile</i>. A commentator
on this relic informs us that it represents a Wassel Bowl, so beloved
of yore by our hardy ancestors, "who, on the vigil of the New Year,
never failed to assemble round the glowing hearth with their cheerful
neighbours, and then, in the spicy Wassel Bowl (which testified the
goodness of their hearts) drowned every former animosity&mdash;an
example worthy of modern imitation. <i>Wassel</i> was the word, Wassel
every guest returned, as he took the circling goblet from his friend,
whilst song and civil mirth brought in the infant year."</p>

<p>A work entitled "Naogeorgus," but generally styled the "Popish
Kingdom," published in 1570, and translated by Barnabe Googe, thus
refers to the New Year's Day ceremonies of the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 32em;"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>I remember, very recently, at the conclusion of a public jubilee
dinner, within a very few miles from Manchester, one of the guests
suddenly died of apoplexy. This sad event, of course, caused the adjournment
of the festive gathering. The reason I refer to it here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
merely to state that I heard, to my surprise, one of the country visitors
say, in a very consolatory tone, "Well, poor Joe, God rest his soul!
He has, at least, gone to his long rest wi' a bally full o' good me-at,
and that's some consolation." This seems to illustrate the meaning of
the last couplet in the quotation from "Naogeorgus," the sentiment
in which appears to have some affinity to the Greek and Roman
notions of providing the dead with food and money to aid their
passage across the Styx.</p>

<p>The Rev. S. Baring-Gould, in his "Curious Myths of the Middle Ages,"
says "it is a singular fact that only the other day I heard of a man in
Cleveland (Yorkshire) being buried two years ago with a candle, a penny,
and a bottle of wine in his coffin: the candle to light him along the
road, the penny to pay the ferry, and the wine to nourish him as he
went to the New Jerusalem. I was told this, and this explanation
was given to me by some rustics who professed to have attended
the funeral. This looks to me as though the shipping into the
other land were not regarded merely as a figure of speech, but as a
reality."</p>

<p>One writer says the "high feast of Yule lasted until the twelve days
be passed," and consequently included our new year and twelfth night
festivities. During this period a strong superstition yet obtains in
Lancashire and Yorkshire respecting fire. A singular instance of this
recently occurred to a friend of mine within three miles of Manchester.
Seeing a cottage door open, he entered, and asked the good woman of
the house to give him a light for his cigar. He was somewhat
astonished at her inhospitable response: "Nay, nay, I know better
than that." "Better than what?" he inquired. "Why, better than
give a light out of the house on New Year's Day!" He contrived, notwithstanding,
to ignite his cigar without the woman's assistance, and
she seemed content. She had forgotten the best half of the condition,
however, and committed the very blunder she sought to avoid. According
to Sir Henry Ellis, in the North of England the superstition
ordains that you "never allow any to take a light out of your house on
New Year's Day; a death in the household, before the expiration of
a year, is sure to occur if it be allowed."</p>

<p>Sir Henry Ellis likewise mentions a curious superstition still existing
in Lincolnshire. It is considered unlucky to let anything be taken
out of the house on New Year's Day, before something has been
brought into it. The importation of the most insignificant article,
even a piece of coal, is, it appears, sufficient to prevent the misfortunes
occurring, which the contrary action, it is believed, would render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
inevitable during some portion of the year. This sentiment is
expressed in the following popular rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take out, then take in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bad luck will begin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take in, then take out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good luck comes about.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A remarkable instance of the strength of the superstitious reverence
for this day, or rather of the popular belief in the prophetic character of
any incident occurring thereon, recently happened in Manchester. A
publican, name Tilley, refused to serve a glass of whisky <i>on credit</i>
during the New Year's Day's festivities, on the score that it was
"unlucky" so to do. He said he preferred making the man a present
of the liquor to the committal of any such act. The refusal so
exasperated the thirsty customer that he stabbed the landlord in the
abdomen, and, as the wound proved fatal, he was condemned to death
for wilful murder, but the sentence was afterwards commuted to penal
servitude for life. Thus the faith in the tradition produced a more
tragic result than the most superstitious could have dreaded from its
ignoration. Singularly enough, owing to the first day of the year
happening on Sunday, the usual festival was postponed till the following
day; so it appears in this instance the superstition accompanied the
merry-making without reference to the date.</p>

<p>This practice of "bringing in the New Year" with festive rejoicing
is still a very common one, especially in the north of England. A singular
superstition in connection with it is evidently of very ancient origin.
It is considered to be an unlucky omen if the first person who enters
a house on the morning of the first of January happens to be a
female.</p>

<p>Another unlucky omen is yet very commonly respected in Lancashire
and elsewhere, even amongst comparatively educated people, at
this festive season. It is considered to bode misfortune if the first
person who enters your house on New Year's morning has a fair complexion
and light hair. I have never heard this very popular prejudice
satisfactorily accounted for. I can only suggest that it most
probably arose from the fact that amongst the Keltic tribes, or the
earliest Aryan immigrants, dark hair prevailed, as amongst the Welsh,
Cornish, and Irish of the present day; and that when they afterwards
came in contact with the Teutonic branch, as enemies, they found
their mortal foes to possess fair skins and light hair. They consequently
regarded the intrusion into their household, at the commencement
of the year, of one of the hated race, as a sinister omen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
beards and hair of the ancient Aryan gods were golden or red, or fire-coloured.
The Teutonic Thor, in this respect, was the counterpart
of Indra and Agni. Red hair, no doubt, would have its admirers,
where these gods were worshipped; and, of course, it would fall into
contempt when the reverse was the case. The German early Christians,
it appears, not only condemned Thor to the lower regions, but
carried their dislike to the very colour of his hair. Hence the proverb,
"Rother-bart, Teufelsart," or "Red-beard, devil-steered."
They went so far, indeed, as to assert, without any other authority
than the speciality of his personal character, that the beard of the
arch-traitor, Judas Iscariot, was of this obnoxious colour. Dryden
refers to it in the triplet which he despatched to Jacob Tonson, as a
specimen of his power as a satirist, and which caused the celebrated
publisher to deal more liberally than previously with the poor and
angry poet. Dryden's lines are:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With leering look, bull-faced, and freckled fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two left legs, with <i>Judas</i>-coloured hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frowsy pores that taint the ambient air.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Kelly says the prejudice is of German and not of Eastern origin.
Hence it is not improbable that the dethronement of the red-haired
gods may have been at the root of the German antipathy. But the
true Kelt does not simply abhor, on New Year's Day, the red hair of
the Dane, but the brown or flaxen, or amber locks of the German as
well. Indeed, black or dark hair and complexion are the chief objects
of his concern in the individual who first enters his domicile on the
dawn of the New Year.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Many householders feast their friends on
New Year's Eve, and send out shortly before midnight one of the party,
with dark hair, expressly "to bring in the New Year," as it is termed.
I remember, some time ago, the landlady of one of the Preston hotels,
being unmarried, was in the habit of rewarding the fortunate dark-haired
gentleman with a kiss for his propitious entrance into her
hostelry on the morning of this festivity. Of course, the fair one had
nothing but frowns and harsh words if a light-haired interloper
happened to first cross her threshold.</p>

<p>Mr. T. T. Wilkinson, in his "Popular Customs and Superstitions
in Lancashire," referring to the practice of divination at this season
of the year, says:&mdash;"When a Lancashire damsel desires to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
what sort of a husband she will have, on New Year's Eve she pours
some melted lead into a glass of water and observes what forms the
drops assume. When they resemble scissors, she concludes that she
must rest satisfied with a tailor; if they appear in the form of a hammer,
he will be a smith or a carpenter; and so of the others. I have
met with many instances of this class in which the example given did
not admit of easy contradiction."</p>

<p>The prophetic character of the weather during this period is a superstition
common to all the Aryan tribes. So strongly is this characteristic
of the season felt in Lancashire, at the present day, that
many country people may be met with who habitually found their
"forecast," as the late Admiral Fitzroy would term the operation, on
the appearance of the heavens on Old Christmas Day. Mr. T. T.
Wilkinson relates a singular instance of this superstition, which
shows the stubbornness of traditional lore, even when subjected to
the power and influence of legislative enactments. He says:&mdash;"The
<i>use</i> of the <i>old style</i> in effect is not yet extinct in Lancashire.
The writer knows an old man, R. H., of Habergham, about 77 years
of age, who always reckons the changes of the seasons in this manner.
He alleges the practice of his grandfather and father in support
of his method, and states with much confidence that 'Perliment
didn't change t' seasons wen they chang'd day o' t' month.'"</p>

<p>The New Year's advent is still believed to be a period especially
favourable for divination of various kinds. A work named the
"Shepherd's Kalender," published in 1709, soberly informs us that
"if New Year's Day in the morning open with dusky red clouds, it
denotes strifes and debates among great ones, and many robberies to
happen that year."</p>

<p>The "weatherwise" placed much reliance on the prophetic aspect
of the heavens at this period. A clergyman at Kirkmich&aelig;l, quoted by
Sir John Sinclair, says, with reference to the practices of some of his
parishioners,&mdash;"On the first night of January they observe with
anxious attention the disposition of the atmosphere. As it is
calm or boisterous; as the wind blows from the north or the south,
from the east or the west, they prognosticate the nature of the weather
till the conclusion of the year. The first night of the new year when
the wind blows from the west they call <i>dar-na-coille</i>, the night of the
fecundation of the trees; and from the circumstance has been derived
the name in the Gaelic language. Their faith in the above signs is
couched in verses thus translated:&mdash;'The wind of the south will produce
heat and fertility; the wind of the west milk and fish; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
wind of the north cold and storm; the wind from the east fruit on
the trees.'"</p>

<p>A curious custom of this class is mentioned by Sir Henry Ellis,
termed "Apple-howling," as being well known in Sussex, Devon,
and elsewhere. Troops of boys gather round the orchards on New
Year's Eve, and chant the following ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stand fast root, bear well top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray God send us a howling crop;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every twig, apples big;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every bough, apples enow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hats full, caps full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full quarter sacks full.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The practice of divining or "fore-casting" the character of the
weather, and influencing the vegetation of the coming year, by ceremonies
and observations of atmospheric effects, at its commencement,
or on New Year's Day, appears to be prefigured in the ancient Aryan
mythology. On this subject Walter Kelly says:&mdash;"In the gloomy
season of the winter solstice the Ribhus" (demi-gods, who aid in the
ruling of the lightning and storms) "sleep for twelve days in the
house of the sun-god Savitar; then they wake up and prepare the
earth to clothe itself anew with vegetation, and the frozen waters to
flow again. It appears certain, from some passages in the Vedas,
that twelve nights about the winter solstice were regarded as prefiguring
the character of the weather for the whole year. A Sanscrit text
is noticed by Weber, which says expressly, 'The twelve nights are an
image of the year.' The very same belief exists at this day in
Northern Germany. The peasants say that the calendar for the
whole year is made in the twelve days between Christmas and
Epiphany, and that as the weather is on each of these days so will it
be on the corresponding month of the ensuing year. They believe
also that whatever one dreams on any of the twelve nights will come
to pass within the next year."</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the New Style, previously referred to,
this weather fore-casting was indulged in at the end of March.
Brand gives an old rhyme which demonstrates the truth of this:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">March said to Aperill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I see three hogs upon a hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But lend your first three days to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I'll be bound to gar them dee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The first it sall be wind an' weet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The next it sall be snaw an' sleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The third it sall be sic a freeze,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But when the borrowed days were gane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The three silly hogs came hirplin hame.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Mr. Henderson, in his recent work on the "Folk-Lore of the
Northern Counties," says, "Old people presage the weather of the
coming season by that of the last three days of March, which they
call the 'borrowing days,' and thus rhyme about:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"March borrowed from April<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Three days, and they were ill;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The last o' them war wind an' rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gaed the silly pair ewes come toddling hame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mistletoe and the oak were both of sacred, or "lightning"
origin amongst the Aryans, and the medicinal, mythical, or magical
character yet attributed to the former both by the Teutons and Kelts,
had, doubtless, one common origin. Walter Kelly says the mistletoe
"possesses, in a high degree, all the virtues proper to botanic lightning,
as is implied in its Swiss name, <i>donnerbesen</i>, 'thunderbesom,' and its
mode of growth is conformable in all particulars to its exalted
mythical character. It is a parasite, and like the asvattha and the
rowan, it is everywhere believed to spring from seed deposited by
birds on trees. When it was found on the oak, the Druids ascribed
its growth directly to the gods; they <i>chose</i> the tree; and the bird was
their messenger, perhaps a god in disguise." The mistletoe was supposed
to protect the homestead from fire and other disaster; and,
like many other mysterious things, it was believed to be potent in
matters relating to courtship and matrimony. It is to this sentiment
we owe the practice of kissing under the bush formed of holly and
mistletoe during the Christmas festivities.</p>

<p>This matrimonial element in the mysticism which attaches to the
mistletoe is artistically presented in the Scandinavian mythology.
Freyja, the mother of Baldr, had rendered him invulnerable against
all things formed out of the then presumed four elements, fire, air,
earth, and water. The mistletoe was believed to grow from none of
these elements. Another version is that she swore all created things
never to hurt this the "whitest" and most loved of all the &AElig;sir;
but she overlooked one insignificant branch of the mistletoe, and it
was by an arrow fashioned from it that the bright day-god, Baldr,
the Scandinavian counterpart of Apollo and Bel, was killed by the
blind Hodr or Helder. The gods, however, restored him to life, and
dedicated the mistletoe to his mother, who is regarded as the counterpart
of the classical Venus. Hence its importance in affairs of love
and courtship. It is not improbable that the far-famed dart of Cupid
may have some relationship to the mistletoe arrow to which the beautiful
Baldr succumbed. In a Vedic incantation, translated by Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Kuhn, this death-dealing power of the mistletoe is ascribed to a branch
of the <i>asvattha</i>.</p>

<p>The medicinal qualities of the mistletoe were also in high repute.
"This healing virtue, which the mistletoe shares with the ash," says
Kelly, "is a long-descended tradition, for '<i>the kustha the embodiment of
the soma</i>,' a healing plant of the highest renown among the Southern
Aryans, was one of those that grew beneath the heavenly asvattha."
This heavenly asvattha is the <i>ficus religiosa</i>, or "world tree," "out of
which the immortals shaped the heavens and the earth;" and it is
supposed to be the prototype of the yggdrasil, the cloud-tree of the
Norsemen, "an ash (Norse <i>askr</i>), the tree out of which the gods formed
the first man, who was thence called Askr. The ash was also among
the Greeks, an image of the clouds, and the mother of men." The
Christmas tree of the Germans, recently imported into this country,
no doubt originated in these ancient mythical superstitions.</p>

<p>The wide-spread traditionary belief in this world-overspreading
tree is confirmed by a passage in Merlin's celebrated prophecy. The
magician says, "After this shall be produced a tree upon the Tower
of London, which, having no more than three branches, shall overshadow
the surface of the whole island." Of course Merlin is speaking
figuratively of the future prospects of Britain, and refers to the
domination of London as the metropolitan city of the British empire.
Nevertheless, the origin of the mythical language used for this purpose
appears to admit of no doubt.</p>

<p>The famous bean-stalk up which the renowned "Jack," of nursery
story, climbed till he reached cloud-land, the abode of fairies and
giants, is, unquestionably, a remnant of the Scandinavian yggdrasil,
or cloud-tree. Beans and peas, as will be hereafter shown, in the
Aryan myths, were connected with celestial fire, and with departed
spirits. This Gothic skiey realm has likewise its counterpart in the
Greek Ph&aelig;akian domain, or "cloudland geography," as Mr. Cox aptly
expresses it.</p>

<p>A certain reverence for both the oak and the ash exists yet in the
minds of others better educated than the peasantry of England.
The phrase, "Our hearts of oak," may shortly be superseded by
"Our iron-clads," but the figure of speech, as applied to the fighting
sailor, and not to the craft, will long survive the era of the conversion
of the ships. The oak and the ash are weather-prophets
at this day. An old rhyme says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If the oak's before the ash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall only get a splash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the ash precede the oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall surely get a soak.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>This, of course, refers to the priority in the time of budding or
coming into leaf.</p>

<p>Other Christmas customs and superstitions appear to distinctly
exhibit an Aryan origin. The white-thorn is supposed to possess
supernatural power, and certain trees of this class, in Lancashire
called Christmas thorns, are believed to blossom only on Old Christmas
Day. Mr. Wilkinson says that, in the neighbourhood of Burnley,
many persons will yet travel a considerable distance "at midnight, in
order to witness the blossoming." In the Arboretum at Kew gardens,
Miss Pratt informs us, in her "Flowers, and their Associations,"
there is a tree of this kind which "is often covered with its clusters
while the snow surrounds it." The thorn, as I shall afterwards show,
was an Aryan "lightning plant," and, therefore, supposed to be endowed
with supernatural properties.</p>

<p>The boar's head yet forms a prominent object amongst the traditionary
dishes of Christmas festivities. Amongst the impersonations
of natural phenomena in the Aryan mythology, the wild boar
represented the "ravages of the whirlwind that tore up the earth."
The boar is an animal connected with the storm and lightning, in all
the Indo-European mythologies. Kelly says:&mdash;"Boars are winds, and
their white flashing tusks were looked upon by the southern Aryans
and the Greeks, as well as by the Germans, as images of the lightning."
There exists yet a traditionary superstition very prevalent in
Lancashire and its neighbourhood to the effect that pigs can "<i>see the
wind</i>." I accidentally heard the observation made not long ago, in
the city of Manchester, in what is termed "respectable society," and
no one present audibly dissented. One or two individuals, indeed,
remarked that they had often heard such was the case, and seemed
to regard the phenomenon as related to the strong scent and other
instincts peculiar to animals of the chase. Indeed, Dr. Kuhn says
that in Westphalia this phase of the superstition is the prevalent one.
There pigs are said to smell the wind. No one except myself, in the
Manchester instance referred to, appeared to have any knowledge of
the origin of the tradition, or that it was, <i>at least</i>, between three and
four thousand years old, and, in all probability, very much older.</p>

</div><div class="rgt"><i>Sir John Suckling.</i></div></div>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">Many</span> scarcely yet obsolete ceremonies and superstitions peculiar to
the spring time of the year may likewise be traced to the ancient fire
or sun worship, and other Aryan sources. That the sun rose on
Easter-day, and danced with delight in honour of the resurrection of
Christ, is evidently an ancient superstition engrafted on an orthodox
Christian tenet. This sun-dancing belief is thus rebuked in the
"Athenian Oracle":&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why does the sun at his rising play more on Easter-day than
Whitsunday? The matter of fact is an old weak, superstitious error,
and the sun neither plays nor works on Easter-day more than any
other. It's true, it may sometimes happen to shine brighter that
morning than any other; but, if it does, 'tis purely accidental. In
some parts of England they call it the lamb-playing, which they look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for, as soon as the sun rises, in some clear spring or water, and is
nothing but the pretty reflection it makes from the water, which they
may find at any time, if the sun rises clear and they themselves early,
and unprejudiced with fancy."</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne, referring to this subject, says:&mdash;"We shall
not, I hope, disparage the Resurrection of our Redeemer if we say
that the sun doth not dance on Easter-day; and though we would
willingly assent to any sympathetical exultation, yet we cannot conceive
therein any more than a tropical expression."</p>

<p>These extracts are sufficient to show the "toughness" of the traditionary
belief, and that its probable origin is of an earlier date than
the Christian festivities of Easter. Some derive the term Easter
from the Saxon Oster, to rise; others "from one of the Saxon goddesses,
called Eastre, whom they always worshipped at this season."
Others, again, prefer the Anglo-Saxon root, signifying a storm, "the
time of Easter being subject to the continual recurrence of tempestuous
weather."</p>

<p>The procuring of original or "need-fire," from flint and steel at
this season, has been previously referred to. At Reading, in 1559, it
appears by the churchwardens' account, yet extant, that 5s. 8d. was
"paid for makynge of the Paschall and Funte Taper." Two
years previously, one made for the abbey church of Westminster
weighed three hundred pounds!</p>

<p>A quaint old writer, in a work called "The Festival," published in
1511, referring to these "need-fires," says:&mdash;"This day is called, in
many places, Godde's Sondaye: ye knowe well that it is the maner
at this day to do the fyre out of the hall, and the blacke wynter
brandes, and all thyngs that is foule with fume and smoke shall be
done awaye, and there the fyre was shall be gayly arayed with fayre
floures, and strewed with grene rysshes all aboute."</p>

<p>The coloured eggs thrown into the air or knocked against each
other, at Easter, by adults as well as children, are, doubtless, remnants
of the Aryan myth, which typified the renovated sun of the
spring season by a red or golden egg. Schwartz says it was a custom
among the Parsees to distribute red eggs at their spring festival. De
Gebelin, in his "Religious History of the Calendar," traces this
Easter custom to the ancient Egyptians, Persians, Gauls, Greeks,
Romans, and others, "amongst all of whom an egg was an emblem
of the universe, the work of the Supreme Divinity." In the nursery
tale of "Jack and the Bean-stalk," evidently descended from an
Aryan source, one of the hero's feats is the abduction from the giant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
castle in "cloudland" of the hen that, at the bidding of its owner,
laid golden eggs.</p>

<p>Brand says:&mdash;"Belithus, a ritualist of ancient times, tells us that
it was customary in some churches for the bishops and archbishops
themselves to play with the inferior clergy at <i>hand-ball</i>, and
this, as Durand asserts, even on Easter-day itself. Why they
should play at hand-ball at this time, rather than any other game,
Bourne tells us he has not been able to discover; certain it is, however,
that the present custom of playing at that game on Easter
holidays for a tansy-cake has been derived from thence. Erasmus,
speaking of the proverb, <i>Mea est pila</i>, that is, 'I got the ball,' tells us
that it signifies 'I've obtained the victory; I am master of my
wishes.'"</p>

<p>Brand seems to have hit upon the most probable origin of this ball-playing,
which appears to be but another form of the Easter egg-throwing;
but, in consequence of his non-acquaintance with the
Sanscrit writings and the common Aryan origin of the greater portion
of the modern European populations, he sets it forth with great diffidence.
He says:&mdash;"It would, perhaps, be indulging fancy too far to
suppose that the bishops and governors of the churches, who used to
play at hand-ball at this season, did it <i>in a mystical way</i>, and with
reference to the <i>triumphal joy of the season</i>."</p>

<p>Mysteries, moralities, or miracle plays were performed at Easter,
either by, or with the sanction of, the ecclesiastical authorities. In
the "Sleaford-Gild Account Book" there is an entry, under the date
1480, as follows:&mdash;"Payd for the Ryitiuall of ye play for the Ascencion,
and the wrytyng of spechys, and payntyng of a garment for God,
iij. <i>s.</i> viij. <i>d.</i>"</p>

<p>In the Red Book of the Corporation of Kilkenny there is an entry
at Midsummer, in 1586, which states that one Richard Cogan played
the part of Christ. His fee for the performance is not stated, but
Henry Moore received eightpence for acting the Devil, while the
Kilkenny baker was only rewarded with sixpence for personating
the Archangel Michael.</p>

<p>Similar observances obtained until recently at other spring festivals,
all having, doubtless, a common origin.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> They evidently refer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
increasing power of the sun, the passing away of the winter storms,
and the joy of the people at the prospect of an abundant supply of
the products of the earth. Reginald Scot, in his "Discovery of
Witchcraft," published in 1584, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In some countries they run out of the doors in time of tempest,
blessing themselves with a cheese" (another sun emblem, owing to
its form), "whereupon was a cross made with a rope's end, upon
Ascension Day.&mdash;Item, to hang an egg, laid on Ascension Day, in
the roof of the house, preserveth the same from all hurts."</p>

<p>During the last thirty or forty years two Easter customs seem to
have declined rapidly in Lancashire and the North of England.
Many <i>troupes</i> of boys, and, in some instances, grown-up persons, not
very long ago, decorated themselves with ribbons, or party-coloured
paper in the most fantastic style, and sallied forth during Easter week
"a pace-egging," as it was termed. One of their number rejoiced
in the euphonious cognomen of "Tosspot." His face was blacked
with soot, and he carried a basket on his arm for the purpose of
receiving contributions in the shape of "pace" or "Paschall" eggs.
Of course, the sovereign substitute for all commercial articles, current
coin of the realm, was equally acceptable to the dingy and somewhat
diabolical-looking treasurer; for the said "Tosspot" bore remarkable
resemblance, both in complexion and some other characteristics, to the
"Old Nick" of the Norsemen. These "pace-egging" gentry generally
wore wooden swords, with which rival <i>troupes</i>, meeting in the streets,
occasionally entered into mimic combat that was not always bloodless
in its result. The <i>troupe</i> sometimes played a kind of rude drama,
in which I remember a certain knight having mortally wounded an
enemy, vociferously called out for a "doctor," offering the sum of ten
pounds as a special fee for his immediate appearance. Others sang
some barbarous rhymes, evidently modern versions of older strains,
in which Lords Nelson and Collingwood figured conspicuously. I
remember well, in my younger days, having taken a part in more
than one of these performances at Preston. In the neighbourhood
of Blackburn, men, with blackened faces, dressed in the skins
of animals and otherwise disfigured, paraded the streets and lanes on
these occasions, and, I suppose, obtained much "pace-egg" money,
from the terror they inspired. It is not very many years ago since I
met a <i>troupe</i> of this class in the village of Walton-le-dale, near
Preston, that levied its "black-mail" with considerable success.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the mummery practised at Easter, in
Lancashire, resulted merely from the transfer of the May-day games,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the orgies of the "Lord of Misrule," the "hobby-horse," the Morris
dancers, &amp;c., to this festival. The time of holding of holidays, and the
character of the amusements, vary in different localities, and they are
not unfrequently blended one with another, when the original purport
of each has ceased to be remembered or regarded in the light of a
religious festival. The May-day mummeries in London, in Brand's
days, and even yet, appear to have borne some resemblance to the
Lancashire Easter performances. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The young chimney sweepers, some of whom are fantastically
dressed in girls' clothes, with a great profusion of brick-dust, by way
of paint, gilt paper, &amp;c., making a noise with their shovels and
brushes, are now the most striking object in the celebration of May-day
in the streets of London."</p>

<p>The obtaining of alms, or rather "largesses," as they would term
it in "the olden time," appears to have been the chief object of both
parties. Indeed, this element in the performance it appears was not
confined to the sweeps of London or the "Tosspots" of Lancashire,
for Brand further observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remember, too, that in walking that same morning, between
Houndslow and Brentford, I was met by two distinct parties of <i>girls</i>,
with garlands of flowers, who begged money of me, saying, 'Pray,
sir, remember the garland.'"</p>

<p>The other custom referred to consisted in the "lifting" of women
by men on Easter Monday, and the indulgence in a similar freak, on
the following day, by the fair sex, on their masculine friends, by way
of retaliation. It was commonly performed in the public streets, and
caused much amusement; but it was a rude and indelicate piece of
practical joking, which can very well be dispensed with, notwithstanding
the faith of some that the practice was originally intended
to typify the Resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p>Bayard Taylor, in his "Byeways of Europe," gives an interesting
account of Andorra, a little republic situated in the heart of the
Pyrenees, between France and Spain. This secluded state has
enjoyed an independent existence since the days of Charlemagne,
and the manners and customs of its inhabitants are of the most
simple and primitive character. Mr. Taylor refers to a singular
custom that obtains amongst them, and which bears some resemblance
to the Lancashire one just referred to. He says, "Before
Easter, the unmarried people make bets, which are won by whoever,
on Easter morning, can first catch the other and cry out, 'It is
Easter, the eggs are mine!' Tricks, falsehoods, and deceptions of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
kinds are permitted; the young man may even surprise the maiden
in bed, if he can succeed in doing so. Afterwards they all assemble
in public, relate their tricks, eat their Easter eggs, and finish the day
with songs and dances."</p>

<p>Cakes and buns are baked at this season, which are supposed to
possess supernatural properties. Sir Henry Ellis says, "It is an old
belief that the observance of the custom of eating buns on Good
Friday protects the house from fire, and several other virtues are
attributed to these buns."</p>

<p>In "Poor Robin's Almanack" for 1733, is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Good Friday comes this month, the old woman runs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one or two a penny hot cross-buns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose virtue is, if you believe what's said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll not grow mouldy like the common bread.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The baking of cross-buns at Easter is evidently but a legitimate descendant
of the cake baking of the olden festivities. Some consider
the cross on the buns as an addition since the introduction of Christianity;
others think it may be the remains of an older observance.
Dr. Kuhn, speaking of the crosses on ancient boundary and bridal
oaks, says an oak formerly grew in a wood near Dahle, around which
newly-married couples danced three times, and afterwards cut a
cross on it. This cross, he contends, originally represented "Thor's
hammer, the consecrator of marriage." The latter was unquestionably
one form of the many phallic symbols. Mr. Baring-Gould notices
the prohibitions issued at various times against the carrying about
of ploughs and ships, especially on Shrove Tuesday, because
they were phallic symbols. A writer in the <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>,
although he considers the planting of the old boundary oak as a
Saxon institution, yet regards the placing of the cross thereon as
a withdrawal of the tree "from the dominion of Thor or Odin."
Kelly, in reply to this, says:&mdash;"More or less it did so in Christian
times, but previously to then the cross as well as the tree may have
belonged to Thor." The cross, in some of its varied forms, has
evidently been used as a mythical type from the earliest period of
traditional history. I remember, only a very few years ago, when on
a visit to Brampton, in Cumberland, being shown, in the neighbourhood,
the locality on which one of these ancient marriage oaks had
grown for ages. It had only recently been cut down, to the chagrin
of many of the neighbouring inhabitants.</p>

<p>A writer in "<i>Once a Week</i>," referring to this subject, says, "Do
our Ritualists eat hot cross-buns on Good Friday? Perhaps they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
do not, but consider the consumption of such cakes to be a weak
concession to the childish appetites of those who would not duly
observe their Lenten fastings; and who, had they lived in the days
of George III., would have been among the crowds who clustered
beneath the wooden porticos of the two 'royal,' and rival, bun-houses
at Chelsea. But there is the cross-mark on the surface of
the bun to commend it to the minds which are favourably disposed
to symbolism; and there is the history of the cross-bun itself, which
goes back to the time of Cecrops, and to the <i>liba</i> offered to Astarte,
and to the Jewish passover cakes, and to the eucharistic bread, or
cross-marked wafers, mentioned in St. Chrysostom's Liturgy, and
thence adopted by the early Christians. So that the Good Friday
bun has antiquity and tradition to recommend it; and, indeed, its
very name of <i>bun</i> is but the oblique <i>boun</i>, from <i>bous</i>, the sacred ox,
the semblance of whose horns was stamped upon the cake. There,
too, they also did duty for the horns of Astarte, in which word some
philologists would affect to trace a connection with Easter. The
substitution by the Greeks of the cross-mark in place of the horn-mark
would seem to have chiefly been for the easier division of the
round bun into four equal parts. Such cross-marked buns were
found at Herculaneum."</p>

<p>The "simnels" eaten on Mid-Lent, or "Mothering" Sunday, are,
doubtless, but modern representatives of the ancient festive cake. On
Simnel Sunday young persons especially visit their aged parents, and
make them presents of various kinds, but chiefly of rich cakes.
It is said by some to have been originally called "Mothering Sunday"
from a practice which formerly prevailed of visiting the mother church
or cathedral, for the purpose of making Easter or Lenten offerings.</p>

<p>The word "simnel" has given rise to much discussion amongst
etymologists. It is variously spelled <i>simnell</i>, <i>symnel</i>, or, in Lancashire
especially, <i>simbling</i>. It is not improbable that it possesses some
relationship to the Anglo-Saxon <i>symel</i> or <i>symbel</i>, a feast. Bailey and
Dr. Cowell derive it from the Latin <i>simila</i>, fine flour. The popular
notion is that the father of Lambert Simnel, the pretender to the
throne in the reign of Henry VII., was a famous baker of these cakes,
and that they retain his name in consequence of his great reputation
in confectionery art. This, however, cannot be correct, as simnels
are referred to long before his time. It is far more probable that the
trade gave the name to the man, as in the cases of smith, baker,
tailor, glover, etc. These cakes, like brides'-cakes, are generally
profusely decorated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not improbable that the name "simnel" was in Saxon times
employed to designate a finer or superior kind of bread or cake. It
occurs in the "Lay of Havelock the Dane," a French romance,
abridged by Geoffroi Gaimer, the Anglo-Norman trouv&egrave;re. This
"Le Lai de Aveloc," Professor Morley says, belongs to the first half
of the twelfth century. He considers it to have been founded on "an
English tradition that must have been extant in Anglo-Saxon times,
for Gaimer speaks of it as an ancient story." The lay says that when
the fisherman Grim, the founder of the town of Grimsby, "caught the
great lamprey, he carried it to Lincoln, and brought home wastels,
<i>simnels</i>, his bags full of meal and corn, neats' flesh, sheep and swine's
flesh, and hemp for the making of more lines."</p>

<p>Since the above was written, the following paragraph on this subject
appeared in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Simnel Cakes.</span>&mdash;A well-known Lancashire antiquary some time
since stated that this term 'originally meant the <i>very finest</i> bread,
<i>Pain demain</i> is another term for it, on account of its having been
used as <i>Sunday bread</i>' (if a conjecture may be hazarded, it is possible
there may be some connexion with the shew bread and heathen votive
offerings, as in India and China) 'at the Sacrament. The name
appears in Medi&aelig;val Latin as <i>simanellus</i>, and may thus have been
derived from the Latin <i>simila</i>&mdash;fine flour. In Wright's 'Vocabularies'
it appears thus:&mdash;'<i>Hic artocopus&mdash;symnelle.</i>' This form was in
use during the fifteenth century. In the 'Dictionarius' of John de
Garlande, compiled at Paris in the thirteenth century, it appears
thus:&mdash;'<i>Simeneus&mdash;placent&aelig;</i>&mdash;simnels.' Such cakes were stamped
with the figure of Christ or of the Virgin.' Is it not a little singular
that this custom of making these cakes, and also the practice of
assembling in one place to eat them, should be confined to Bury?
Such is the fact. No other town or district in the United Kingdom is
known to keep up such a custom.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> As stated above, much labour has
been expended to trace its origin, but without success."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p><p>Mid-Lent Sunday is likewise called Braggat or Braggot Sunday,
from the custom of drinking "mulled" or spiced ale on that day. The
word is believed to be derived from the ancient British <i>bragawd</i>,
which signifies a liquor of this class. The Braggat ales drunk on
Braggat Sunday have, no doubt, intimate connection with the buns
and cake of the other spring festivities. The solid and fluid elements,
in some form or other, appear to be indispensable in all festive gatherings,
religious or otherwise. Bacchus and Ceres, or Dionysos and
D&ecirc;met&ecirc;r, were jointly honoured at the festivals attendant upon the
celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries. Shakspere makes Sir Toby
Belch exclaim, on Malvolio's interference with their noisy festive
roystering, "Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall
be no more cakes and ale?"</p>

<p>In an old glossary of the Lancashire dialect, published in 1775,
"carlings" are described as "Peas boiled on Care Sunday, <i>i.e.</i>, the
Sunday before Palm Sunday." "Parched" peas, or peas fried in
pepper, butter, and salt, form yet a favourite dish amongst the poorer
classes in the north of England on "Carling Sunday." A tradition,
indeed, still exists, which asserts that, during a very severe famine,
a vessel opportunely arrived in one of the ports, laden with a cargo of
peas, to the great delight of the inhabitants; and the "carling" feast
is regarded as a memorial of the event.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Peas and beans have had symbolical or sacred characteristics from
the earliest times. Beans were regarded by the Greeks and Romans,
according to Plutarch, as highly potent in the invocation of the <i>manes</i>
of the departed. Brand says: "There is a great deal of learning in
Erasmus's Adages concerning the <i>religious use of beans</i>, which were
thought to belong to the dead. An observation which he gives us of
Pliny, concerning Pythagoras's interdiction of this pulse is highly
remarkable. It is '<i>that beans contain the souls of the dead</i>.' For
which cause also they were used in the <span class="smcap">Parentalia</span>." He
further adds: "Ridiculous and absurd as these superstitions may
appear, yet it is certain that our carlings thence deduce their origin."</p>

<p>There is not, after all, anything very ridiculous or absurd about
the matter, when the common Aryan origin of these traditionary
superstitions is considered. May not the Roman <i>Parentalia</i>, or the
offering of oblations or sacrifices, consisting of liquors, victims, and
garlands, at stated periods, on the tombs of parents, have had some
remote connection with the "mothering" customs referred to, on Mid-Lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Sunday? Amongst other objects of the Roman ceremonial,
it appears that of an atonement to the ghosts of the departed
was included. The storing of peas and beans for the Lenten season
was carefully attended to in the middle ages, especially at the religious
houses. A French work, printed at Paris, in 1565, entitled "Quadragesimale
Spirituale," gives some curious information on this subject.
Speaking of the Lenten fare, the writer says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After salad we eat <i>fried beanes</i>, by which we understand confession.
When we would have <i>beanes well sooden, we lay them in steepe,
otherwise they will never seeth kindly</i>. Therefore, if we propose to
amend our faults, it is not sufficient barely to confess them at all
adventure, but we must let our confession lie in steepe in the water of
Meditation." He further adds: "River water, which continually
moveth, runneth and floweth, is <i>very good for the seething of pease</i>."</p>

<p>It appears that the modern Greeks have a custom of depositing
<i>parboiled wheat</i> with the dead on interment. Gregory says the ceremony
was intended to "<i>signifie the resurrection of the body</i>." Referring
to peas as an element of the Aryan mythology, Walter Kelly
says; "The plant and the fruit are in some way or other related to
celestial fire. It may be that they were regarded in this light because
they belong to the class of creeping or climbing plants to which such
relations were pre-eminently attributed; at all events, the fact that
they represented something in the vegetation of the sky is substantiated
by numerous details in their mythical history."</p>

<p>According to Dr. Kuhn and Schwartz, the flying dragons that poison
the air and the waters let fall peas in such quantities that they filled
the wells and rendered the water so foul that cattle refused to partake
thereof. In the German traditions the Zwergs, the forgers of Thor's
lightning hammer, were so fond of peas that they plundered the fields
of the husbandman, after rendering themselves invisible by means of
their "caps of darkness." Peas with sour crout are yet eaten in
Berlin on Thursday (Thor's day), from immemorial habit. Mannhardt
speaks of their medical as well as mystical properties, and says
that their relation to the lightning is evidenced by the fact of their
being used as hazel nuts, and the thunderbolts (certain fossil shells
and meteoric stones) to augment the fertility of the corn seed.</p>

<p>A singular custom formerly existed on Maundy Thursday, or the
Thursday preceding Easter, when royal personages distributed alms
to poor persons. It was named Maundy Thursday from the baskets
(or <i>maunds</i>) which contained the gifts. In the "Festival," published
in 1511, it is said to have been likewise called "Shere Thursday,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
because "anciently people would that day shere theyr hedes and
clypp theyr berdes, and so make them honest against Easter-day."
After the distribution of the alms in meat, drink, clothing, and money,
it was customary for royalty, in imitation of the humility of Jesus
Christ, to wash the feet of the recipients of their bounty. James II.
was the last of our monarchs who performed this ceremony in person.
He was likewise the last who successfully (?) "touched" for the cure
of the "king's evil," a conclusive reason to the old Jacobites that his
successors were all usurpers!</p>

<p>This, however, did not appear to have been the orthodox faith in
earlier times. Aubrey, in his "Miscellanies" (1696), gravely relates
that the manner in which the king's evil was cured by the "touch of
the king does much puzzle our philosophers (?); for, whether our
kings were of the house of York or Lancaster, it did the cure <i>for the
most part</i>!" He further informs us that the seventh son of a seventh
son possessed the regal power; but he qualifies the important fact
by the condition that it must be "a seventh son, and no daughter
between, and in pure wedlock." He likewise adds, "The touch of a
dead hand hath wrought wonderful effects." This last superstition
is still current in Lancashire. In the time of James II., the remedial
power of the "king's touch," in cases of scrofula, was firmly believed
in by others than the vulgar; for, it appears, the corporation of
Preston voted the sum of five shillings each to two poor women
afflicted with this disease, towards their expense in travelling to
Chester, which city his Majesty had honoured with a special visit
at the time, to avail themselves of the supposed potency inherent
in the royal digits, under such circumstances. This superstition
was not entirely discountenanced by those in authority until the
reign of George III.</p>

<p>This belief in the supernatural authority of monarchs is but a
remnant of the long supposed "divine right" of kings to govern,
which resulted from the conviction that they could trace their pedigrees
back to the deities themselves. Shakspere, even, puts into the
mouth of the murderer and usurper, Claudius, King of Denmark, the
following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's such divinity doth hedge a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That treason can but peep to what it would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acts little of his will.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">This superstition is by no means confined to civilised or semi-civilised
nations. It is almost a universal feeling amongst savage tribes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The ignorant serf of Russia believed, and indeed yet believes, that if
the deity were to die the emperor would succeed to his power and
authority. Speke, referring to a very childish but nevertheless very
great potentate, who ruled the territory adjacent the Victoria
N'yanza, says, "I found that the Waganda have the same absurd
notion here as the Wangambo have in Karagu&eacute;, of Kamrasi's supernatural
power in being able to divide the waters of the Nile in the
same manner that Moses did the Red Sea."</p>

superstitious reverence, and especially in connection with the spring festivals; and,
singularly enough, Mr. John Ingram, in his delightful "Flora Symbolica," informs

no accidental coincidence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This is an error. Bury is certainly famous for its simnels, but other towns in

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The harshness and general painfulness of life in old times must have been much
relieved by certain simple and affectionate customs which modern people have learned
to dispense with. Amongst these was a practice of going to see parents, and especially
the female one, on the mid Sunday of Lent, taking for them some little present, such
as a cake or a trinket. A youth engaged in this amiable act of duty was said to go
<i>a-mothering</i>, and thence the day itself came to be called Mothering Sunday. One can
readily imagine how, after a stripling or maiden had gone to service, or launched in
independent housekeeping, the old bonds of filial love would be brightened by this
pleasant annual visit, signalised, as custom demanded it should be, by the excitement
attending some novel and perhaps surprising gift. Herrick, in a canzonet addressed
to Dianeme, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll to thee a <i>simnel</i> bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Gainst thou go a-mothering;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that, when she blesses thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half that blessing thou'lt give me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He here obviously alludes to the sweet cakes which the young person brought to the
female parent as a gift; but it would appear that the term "simnel" was in reality
applicable to cakes which were in use all through the time of Lent.... We learn
from Ducange that it was usual in early times to mark the simnels with a figure of
Christ or of the Virgin Mary, which would seem to show that they had a religious
signification. We know that the Anglo-Saxon, and indeed the German race in general,
were in the habit of eating consecrated cakes at their religious festivals. Our hot cross-buns
at Easter are only the cakes which the pagan Saxons ate in honour of their goddess
Eastre, and from which the Christian clergy, who were unable to prevent people
from eating, sought to expel the paganism by marking them with the cross. It is
curious that the use of these cakes should have been preserved so long in this locality,
and still more curious are the tales which have arisen to explain the meaning of the
name, which had been long forgotten. Some pretend that the father of Lambert
Simnel, the well-known pretender in the reign of Henry VII., was a baker, and the
first maker of simnels, and that in consequence of the celebrity he gained by the acts of
his son, the cakes have retained his name. There is another story current in Shropshire,
which is much more picturesque, and which we tell as nearly as possible in the
words in which it was related to us. Long ago there lived an honest old couple, boasting
the names of Simon and Nelly, but their surnames are not known. It was their
custom at Easter to gather their children about them, and thus meet together once a
year under the old homestead. The fast season of Lent was just ending, but still they
had left some of the unleavened dough which had been from time to time converted
into bread during the forty days. Nelly was a careful woman, and it grieved her to
waste anything, so she suggested that they should use the remains of the Lenten dough
for the basis of a cake to regale the assembled family. Simon readily agreed to the
proposal, and further reminded his partner that there were still some remains of their
Christmas plum-pudding hoarded up in the cupboard, and that this might form the
interior, and be an agreeable surprise to the young people when they had made their
way through the less tasty crust. So far, all things went on harmoniously; but when
the cake was made, a subject of violent discord arose, Sim insisting that it should be
boiled, while Nell no less obstinately contended that it should be baked. The dispute
ran from words to blows, for Nell, not choosing to let her province in the household be
thus interfered with, jumped up, and threw the stool she was sitting on at Sim, who on
his part seized a besom, and applied it with right good will to the head and shoulders
of his spouse. She now seized the broom, and the battle became so warm that it might
have had a very serious result, had not Nell proposed as a compromise that the cake
should be boiled first and afterwards baked. This Sim acceded to, for he had no wish
for further acquaintance with the heavy end of the broom. Accordingly, the big pot
was set on the fire, and the stool broken up and thrown on to boil it, whilst the besom
and broom furnished fuel for the oven. Some eggs, which had been broken in the scuffle,
were used to coat the outside of the pudding when boiled, which gave it the shining
gloss it possesses as a cake. This new and remarkable production in the art of confectionery
became known by the name of the cake of Simon and Nelly, but soon only the
first half of each name was alone preserved and joined together, and it has ever since
been known as the cake of Sim-Nel, or Simnel.&mdash;<i>Chambers's Book of Days.</i></p></div>

</div><div class="rgt"><i>Old May-day Song.</i></div></div>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> May-day festivities and superstitious ceremonies belong to the same
antique or pagan class as those previously described. The Irish antiquary,
O'Brien, says that the practice of lighting fires in honour of the
god Bel, on May-day, gave the Irish name "Mina-Bealtine" to the
flowery month. Brand says: "In honour of May-day, the Goths and
Southern Swedes had a mock battle between summer and winter, which
ceremony is retained in the Isle of Man, where the Danes and Norwegians
had been for a long time masters." This, evidently, is a remnant
of an Aryan myth. Olaus Magnus says, the "Northern natives have
a custom to welcome the returning splendour of the sun with dancing,
and mutually to feast each other, rejoicing that a better season for feasting
and hunting was approached." Tollet quaintly says: "Better
judges may decide that the institution of this festival originated from
the Roman Floralia, or from the Celtic La Beltine, while I conceive
it derived to us from our Gothic ancestors." The theory of the common
Aryan source of these festive rites reconciles Tollet's conception
with the decision of the "better judges," for whose opinion he
evidently entertains profound respect. The Rev. Mr. Maurice, in his
learned work on "The Antiquities of India," contends that the May-day
festivities were originally inaugurated at the vernal equinox, and
that they pertained to a "phallic festival to celebrate the generative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
powers of nature." From this stand-point he argues that they are
the remains of very ancient ceremonies well known to Egypt, India,
and other places. His reasoning on this subject is very learned and
ingenious. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the reader calls to mind what has already been observed,
that, owing to a precession of the equinox, after the rate of seventy-two
years to a degree, a total alteration has taken place through all
the signs of the ecliptic, insomuch that those stars which formerly
were in Aries have now got into Taurus, and those of Taurus into
Gemini; and when he considers also the difference before mentioned,
occasioned by the reform of the calendar, he will not wonder at the
disagreement that exists in respect to the exact period of the year on
which the great festivals were anciently kept, and that on which, in
imitation of prim&aelig;val customs, they are celebrated by the moderns.
Now, the vernal equinox, after the rate of that precession, certainly
could not have coincided with the first of May less than four thousand
years before Christ, which nearly marks the &aelig;ra of creation, which,
according to the best and wisest of chronologers, began at the vernal
equinox, when all nature was gay and smiling, and the earth arrayed
in its loveliest verdure, and not, as others have imagined, at the
dreary autumnal equinox, when that nature must necessarily have its
beauty declining, and that earth its verdure decaying. I have little
doubt, therefore, that May-day, or at least the day on which the sun
entered Taurus, has been immemorably kept as a sacred festival
from the creation of the earth and man, and was originally intended
as a memorial of that auspicious period and that momentous
event.... On the general devotion of the ancients to the
worship of the <i>bull</i> I have had frequent occasion to remark, and <i>more
particularly in the Indian history</i>, by their devotion to it at that period&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Aperit cum cornibus annum Taurus.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">'When the bull with his horns openeth the vernal year.' I observed
that all nations seem anciently to have vied with each
other in celebrating that blissful epoch; and that the moment the sun
entered the sign Taurus, were displayed the signals of triumph and
the incentives to passion; that memorials of the universal festivity
indulged in at that season are to be found in the records and customs
of people otherwise the most opposite in manners and most remote in
situation. I could not avoid considering the circumstance as a strong
additional proof that mankind originally descended from one great
family, and proceeded to the several regions in which they finally
settled, from one common and central spot; that the Apis, or sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
bull of Egypt, was only the symbol of the sun in the vigour of
vernal youth; that the bull of Japan, breaking with his horn the
mundane egg, was evidently connected with the same bovine species
of superstition, founded on the mixture of astronomy and mythology."</p>

<p>According to Mr. Maurice's calculation, the vernal equinox could
not have coincided with the first degree of Aries later, at the latest,
than eighteen hundred years before Christ. The festival of the
vernal equinox would then be celebrated on the first of April. The
modern "April fool" freaks are regarded by many writers as relics
of these festivities. In India this is termed the Huli festival. It has
previously been shown that, in modern Welsh, <i>heulo</i> means to shine
as the sun. <i>Heulog</i> likewise means sunny or sunshiny.</p>

<p>The original purport of most of the May-day ceremonials was
unquestionably a demonstration of joy at the return of spring.
Rowe, speaking of the tower of Magdalen College, Oxford, and its
famous peal of ten bells, says, "On May-day the choristers assemble
on the top to usher in the spring." Oxonians of the "olden time,"
appear to have welcomed the season not simply by blowing lustily
through cows' horns, but by drinking deeply from cups fashioned
therefrom. Herne says this blowing and drinking was done "upon
the jollities of the first of May, to remind people of the pleasantness
of that part of the year, which ought to create mirth and gaiety."</p>

<p>In the north of England, especially, Bourne informs us, that the
more youthful portion of the villagers, of both sexes, were in the
habit, at midnight, on the eve of May-day, of rendezvousing in some
neighbouring wood, with the view of gathering green branches of
trees and wild flowers, from which they made garlands, etc., and
carried them in procession during the day. Some of these garlands
were afterwards deposited in the neighbouring churches; others
decorated the doors and windows of the villagers' residences. It
appears that the gathering of these woodspoils was accompanied by
much clangour of rude music, including the blowing of cows' horns,
previously referred to. Stubbs, the Puritan, in his "Anatomy of
Abuses," published in 1585, rebukes this custom on account of the
immoralities which such midnight forest gatherings would doubtless
give rise to. And yet the practice was very common, and was countenanced
by the highest in rank in the kingdom. King Henry VIII.
and his Queen, Katherine of Arragon, and the courtiers, are reported
to have much enjoyed this species of pastime.</p>

<p>Stubbs thus describes the custom he denounces:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Against May, every parish, town, and village assembled themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
together, both men, women, and children, old and young, even
all indifferently, and either going all together or dividing themselves
into companies, they go, some to the woods and groves, some to the
hills and mountains, some to one place, some to another, where they
spend all the night in pastimes, and in the morning they return,
bringing with them birch boughs and branches of trees, to deck their
assembly withal."</p>

<p>Chaucer, in his "Court of Love," makes reference to the May-day
ceremonies of his time, and says that early in the morning "fourth
goth al the Court, both most and lest, to fetche the flouris fresh,
and braunch and blome."</p>

<p>The supposed appropriateness of May-day for love-making is
referred to by Shakspere in "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Lysander, in the first act, wishing to further his suit to Hermia,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">If thou lovest me, then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steal from thy father's house to-morrow night;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where I did meet thee once with Helena,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To do observance of a morn of May</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There will I stay for thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, in the fourth act, when Theseus and his hunting party
discover the two pairs of sweethearts asleep in the wood, the Duke, in
reply to a query by Egeus, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No doubt, <i>they rose up early, to observe</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The rite of May</i>; and, hearing our intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come here in grace of our solemnity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Herrick, in a quaint lyric on this subject, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's not a budding boy or girl, this day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But is got up and gone to bring in May;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deal of youth ere this is come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back, with white-thorn laden home.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Milton thus magnificently apostrophises the advent of the "flowery
month":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the bright morning star, day's harbinger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flow'ry May, who from her green lap throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hail, bounteous May! thou dost inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mirth and youth and fond desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Woods and groves are of thy dressing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus we salute thee with our early song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcome thee and wish thee long.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Old Stowe thus quaintly describes the May-day doings in the
beginning of the seventeenth century:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On May-day, in the morning, every man, except impediment,
would walke into the sweete meadowes and greene woods, there to
rejoyce their spirites with the beauty and savour of sweete flowers,
and with the harmony of birds praysing God in their kind. I find
also that in the moneth of May the citizens of London, of all estates,
lightly in every parish, or sometimes two or three parishes joyning
together, had their severall Mayings, and did fetch in May-poles, with
diverse warlike shewes, with good archers, morice dauncers, and
other devices, for pastime all day long, and towards the evening they
had stage playes and bonfieers in the streets."</p>

<p>Polwhele, in his "History of Cornwall," describes a spring
festival, said to be of very ancient origin, annually celebrated at
Helston on the 8th of May, named the "Furry," or gathering.
The day opens with singing and the beating of drums and
kettles. The whole population rush out of the town into the
country, and return garlanded with leaves and flowers, in which
guise they caper about the streets, and enter unmolested each
others' houses to congratulate their neighbours on the return of
spring.</p>

<p>The young people of Spotland, in the parish of Rochdale, are yet
in the habit of assembling on the hill sides on the first Sunday in
May, and exchanging congratulations on the return of spring. They
drink to each others' health in liquor supplied by the pure mountain
streamlets&mdash;no inapt substitute for the "heavenly soma" of the Vedic
hymns. No doubt, some genuine love-making, as well as much licentiousness,
has resulted from the observance of such ceremonies. It
was formerly a custom, for milkmaids especially, in various parts
of the country, to dance around a "garland" decorated with articles
of value, very much after the fashion of the rush-bearers of Lancashire
at the present day. The latter adorn their rush-cart and its contents
with goblets, watches, and other polished metal articles, lent by friends
for the occasion. Brand, speaking of the milkmaids in the neighbourhood
of London, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They used to dress themselves in holiday guise on this morning,
and come in bands with fiddles, whereto they danced, attended by a
strange-looking pyramidal pile, covered with pewter plates, ribands,
and streamers, either borne by a man upon his head or by two men
upon a hand-barrow; this was called their garland."</p>

<p>Doubtless, the "well-dressing," or the decoration of springs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fountains with flowers, yet very common in some counties, and
especially in Derbyshire, either owes its origin to the Roman
Floralia, or to a still older custom, the common Aryan root of both.
Dr. Stukeley, the celebrated antiquary, writing in 1724, speaks of a
May-pole near Horn Castle, Lincolnshire, on a spot "where probably
stood an Hermes in Roman times." He adds: "The boys annually
keep up the festival of the <i>Floralia</i> on May-day, making a procession
to this hill with May gads (as they call them) in their hands.
This is a white willow wand, the bark peeled off, ty'd round with
cowslips, a thyrsus of the Bacchanals. At night they have a
bonefire, and other merriment, which is really a sacrifice or religious
festival."</p>

<p>The old Puritan writers seem to have entertained a most profound
horror of the ancient May-day festivities. Friar Tuck was pronounced
a remnant of popery; maid Marian was the scarlet lady herself; and
the hobby-horse was consigned to the limbo of defunct pagan superstitions.
A May-pole was an abomination equalled only in atrocity
by a "Whitsun-ale" or a "Morris-dance." Old Stubbs calls the
May-pole a "stinking idol," and says it was brought home with
"great <i>veneration</i>," hence his malediction. The attendant ceremony
he describes as follows: "They have twenty or forty yoke of
oxen, every ox having a sweet nosegay of flowers tied to the tips of
his horns; and these oxen draw home the May-pole, covered all over
with flowers and herbs, bound round with strings from the top to the
bottom, and sometimes painted with variable colours, having two or
three hundred men, women, and children following it with great
<i>devotion</i>." Stubbs evidently knew that the May-pole was of pagan
origin, if he was ignorant of its phallic character.</p>

<p>The court, however, favoured some of these pastimes. King James
I. received a deputation on the subject during his stay at Hoghton
Tower; and at Myerscough, near Preston, in Lancashire, he made a
"speeche about libertie to piping and honest recreation." This was
followed by his famous proclamation, levelled chiefly against the
"Puritans and precise people of Lancashire." This action culminated
in the still more celebrated "Book of Sports." Charles I., in
1633, republished "his blessed father's declaration," which decreed
that "after the end of Divine service, his good people be not disturbed,
letted, or discouraged from any lawful recreation; such as
dancing, either men or women; archery for men, leaping, vaulting,
or any other such harmless recreations; nor from having of May
Games, Whitsun Ales, and Morris Dances, and the setting up of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
May-poles, and other sports therewith used; so as the same may be
had in due and convenient time, without impediment or neglect of
Divine Service. And that women shall have leave to carry rushes to
the church, for the decoration of it according to their old custom.
But withall his Majesty doth hereby account still as prohibited all
unlawful games to be used, on Sundays only, as bear and bull baitings,
interludes, and, at all times, in the meaner sort of people,
as by law prohibited, bowling."</p>

<p>Our ancestors appear to have regarded the playing at bowls as an
especially dignified recreation, and to have guarded by statute the
game from any profanation by the vulgar. Old Strype records that
owing to threatened disturbances in the North of England, a strict
search was made, in every part of the kingdom, on the night of
Sunday, the 10th July, 1569, for vagrants, beggars, gamesters,
rogues, or gipsies. It resulted in the apprehension of thirteen
thousand "masterless men." The chief offence with which they
were charged was that they had no visible mode of living, "except
that which was derived from <i>unlawful</i> games, especially of bowling, and
maintenance of archery."</p>

<p>The sight of a May-pole, so offensive to the Puritan of old, excited
a very different train of thought in the imagination of Washington
Irving, on his first visit to this country. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall never forget the delight I felt on first seeing a May-pole.
It was on the banks of the Dee, close by the picturesque old bridge
that stretches across the river from the quaint little city of Chester.
I had already been carried back into former days by the antiquities of
that venerable place, the examination of which is equal to turning
over the pages of a black letter volume, or gazing on the pictures in
Froissart. The May-pole on the margin of that poetic stream completed
the illusion. My fancy adorned it with wreaths of flowers, and
peopled the green bank with all the dancing revelry of May-day. The
mere sight of this May-pole gave a glow to my feelings, and spread a
charm over the country for the rest of the day; and, as I traversed a
part of the fair plain of Cheshire, and the beautiful borders of Wales,
and looked from among swelling hills down a long green valley,
through which 'the Deva wound its wizard stream,' my imagination
turned all into a perfect Arcadia."</p>

<p>The Laureate, in his beautiful poem, "The May Queen," has most
happily pourtrayed the buoyant, joyous heart-feeling of the modern
juvenile representative of the mythical Maid Marian of old. Eliza
Cook, in one of the most successful of her many truly national songs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
has hit off the spirit of the ancient May-day festivities with remarkable
truthfulness and power:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The people of Lancashire, until very recently, kept the May-day
festival with considerable <i>&eacute;clat</i>. Indeed, it is by no means forgotten
at the present day. The main streets of Preston, Manchester, and
other towns, during "the good old coaching time," presented a
remarkably gay appearance, in consequence of the horses being
decorated, and some of them profusely, with ribbons and other festive
ornaments.</p>

<p>The decoration of horses with flowers and ribbons, the raising of
May-poles, and the attendant dances and games, are yet far from
obsolete in many parts of England. A few years ago I attended a
May-day gathering at a village in North Cheshire; but the dancers,
as well as the May Queen, were all children, and the spectators
chiefly ladies and gentlemen from Manchester and its neighbourhood.
It was a very pretty sight, and was patronised by the neighbouring
"squire" (R. E. Warburton)<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and his family, but it lacked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
healthy rusticity which I had anticipated from the hearty enjoyment
of lusty farm labourers and their sweethearts in the old-fashioned
May-day dance.</p>

<p>The Rev. Jno. E. Sedgwick, of St. Alban's Church, Cheetwood,
Manchester, has recently revived the May-day games; but, although
termed May-day festivities, the decoration of the May-pole, the
crowning of the May Queen, etc., which I visited, took place,
in 1867, in Whit-week, which is the great Manchester holiday.
The children looked pretty with their pink sashes and wreaths of
green leaves, and evidently enjoyed themselves much. With this
exception, however, the affair was in little distinguishable from
ordinary holiday sports, and it certainly lacked the necessary rusticity
to suggest any strong sympathy with the rural festival of the "olden
time."</p>

<p>The practice of gathering hawthorn blossoms, where practicable on
the 1st of May, still continues, and in many localities superstition
lingers respecting the supernatural properties of this tree. The
hanging up in the homestead of a white thorn branch procured on
May-day was supposed to act as an antidote to the machinations of
witchcraft. Both the white and black thorn are considered as representatives
of the <i>Mimosa catechu</i>, the sacred thorn of India, which,
being sprung from lightning, was supposed to be endowed with supernatural
properties. Amongst the Germans "wishing" or "divining"
rods were made from both the black and the white thorn. Walter
Kelly says, "The wood of the thorn (ramnos) was used by the Greeks
for the drilling stick of their pyreia (or fire-producing chark), and
it was held by them to be prophylactic against magic, as the white
thorn was by the Romans, among whom it was used for marriage
torches."</p>

<p>I have referred, in a preceding chapter, to the superstition respecting
the blossoming of the Christmas thorn at midnight, on <i>Old</i>
Christmas eve. The legend has, no doubt, intimate relationship to
the presumed supernatural attributes of the celebrated Glastonbury
thorn, and its progeny. The original plant, according to Collinson's
"History of Somersetshire," was the dry hawthorn staff which St.
Joseph of Arimathea stuck into the ground when weary with
journeying.</p>

<p>In one of the Coventry Mysteries, "The Miraculous Espousal of
Mary and Joseph," the blossoming of the rod of the latter is the sign
that he is the destined husband of the former. When the feeble old
man unwillingly appears before the "bishop Issachar," he is surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to see his staff break out into flower. Issachar is equally astonished,
and exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;" ><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A mercy! mercy! mercy! lord, we crye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blyssyd of God we see art thou!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be this meracle I do wel se;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mary is here name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">This superstition bears evident marks of near relationship to some of
both the Greek and the Indoo, as well as other Eastern mythical faiths.
The blossoming staff of Joseph appears to be but a reproduction of the
budding thyrsus of the Bacchanals and of Hermes, which is regarded
as a phallic symbol, typical of the reproductive forces of nature. In
the Teutonic mythology the fylfot, or revivifying hammer of Thor,
as previously shown, likewise reproduces a phallic symbol.</p>

<p>So highly were branches and blossoms from the Glastonbury thorn
esteemed that Bristol merchants exported large quantities. The
Puritans, in Elizabeth's reign, cut down one of its stems, and the
other was demolished during the "Great Rebellion." Collinson
says, "It is strange to see how much this tree was sought after by
the credulous; and, though a common thorn, Queen Anne, King
James, and many of the nobility of the realm, even when the times
of monkish superstition had ceased, gave large sums of money for
small cuttings from the original."</p>

<p>Some authorities regard this Christmas flowering thorn as a variety
of the <i>crat&aelig;gus monogyna</i>, or common hawthorn, probably brought by the
early crusaders from Palestine. If this be true, it throws some light
on the origin of the reverence in which it was held by the pilgrims to
the shrine of St. Joseph at Glastonbury.</p>

<p>The sacred character of the white thorn especially, appears to
have become interwoven with a great variety of superstitious belief.
A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for July, 1863, treating of "Sacred
Trees and Flowers," says, "The white thorn is one of the trees most
in favour with the small people" [the fairies]; "and both in Brittany
and in some parts of Ireland it is held unsafe to gather even a leaf
from certain old and solitary thorns which grow in sheltered hollows
of the moorland, and are the fairies' trysting places. But no '<i>evil
ghost</i>' dares to approach the white thorn." The writer attributes this
peculiar sanctity of the white thorn to the belief that the crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
placed in derision on the head of Christ, previous to his crucifixion,
was made from branches of this tree; and, doubtless, at the present
day, such may be mainly the case, although, as the writer himself
observes, modern botanical researches have taught us that the fact
"cannot have been so." Kelly says we know more than even this;
"we know that the white thorn was a sacred tree before Christianity
existed, so that we must needs invert the statement of the writer
in the <i>Quarterly</i>, and conclude that the ancient sanctity of
the aub&eacute;pine, or white thorn, was what gave rise to the
medi&aelig;val belief." He further contends that the excerpt relied
upon by the writer, from Sir John Mandeville, who flourished
in the earlier portion of the fourteenth century, shows on
its face that the old wanderer was "an unconscious witness
to the enduring vitality of the Aryan tradition that invested
the hawthorn with the virtues of a tree sprung from the lightning."</p>

<p>The passage referred to is curious. Sir John says, "Then was our
Lord ylad into a gardyn ... and there the Jews scorned hym,
and maden hym a croune of the braunches of the albespyne, that is
white thorn, that grew in the same gardyn, and seten yt on hys heved.... And,
therefore, hath the white thorn many virtues. For he
that beareth a braunch on hym thereof, no thondere, no ne manner
of tempest may dere [hurt] him; ne in the hows that yt is ynne may
non evil ghost entre."</p>

<p>The knowledge of the traditionary faith in the sanctity of this tree
invests with considerable interest the eagerness of children, resident
in populous towns, to obtain a sprig of hawthorn blossom from any
stranger returning from the country with a few branches of this May
trophy. I have had scores of applications of this class for the small
branches which I have carried in my hand from Old Trafford to Manchester.
But, of course, children exhibit a similarly eagerly desire to
obtain possession of flowers, and especially wild flowers, of every
class. Longfellow has beautifully said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Amongst the other virtues ascribed to dew gathered on May-day
morning, its supposed power over the complexion yet finds believers.
Old Pepys, in his most interesting, if sometimes stupid, diary, says:&mdash;"My
wife away down with Jane and W. Hewer to Woolwich, in order
to a little ayre, and to lay there to-night, and so to gather May dew
to-morrow morning, which Mrs. Turner hath taught her is the only
thing in the world to wash her face with; and I am contented with
it." Kelly says: "The Aryan idea, that the rain clouds were cows,
has been well preserved among the Northern nations.... It is
a very common opinion that rain and dew, the milk of the heavenly
cows, are capable of increasing the milk of the earthly cows; hence a
dewy May morning is welcomed as giving promise of a good dairy
year." Mannhardt speaks of a practice in North Germany of tying a
May bush to the tail of the leading cow on May-day morning, in order
that she may brush up the potent dew, and so increase the contents
of her udder. But the strangest faith in the potency of May-dew is
related by Sir John Mandeville. The quaint old traveller seriously
assures us that in Ethiopia there are male and female diamonds that
enter into matrimonial relationship and have offspring! Nay, he
declares that he himself has "<i>often tymes assayed it</i>," and found that
the precious stones do grow year by year, on one condition, namely,
that they be well wetted with May-dew! He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And ther be sume of the gretnesse of a bene, and sume als grete as
an haselle note. And thei ben square and poynted of here owne kinde,
bothe aboven and benethen, withouten worchinge of mannes hond.
And thei growen to gedre, male and femele. And thei ben norysscht
with the dew of Hevene. And thei engendren comounly, and bryngen
forthe smale children, that multiplyen and growen alle the yeer.
I have often tymes assayed, that gif a man kepe hem with a litylle of
the roche, and wete hem with May dew ofte sithes, thei schulle growe
everyche yeer; and the small wole waxen grete."</p>

<p>Sir Kenelm Digby, two centuries ago, in a letter to the younger
Winthorp, governor of New England, expresses his great faith in
the efficacy of dew in the cure of deliriums, frenzies, and manias;
but he does not intimate any preference for dew gathered on May-day.
All dew does not appear, however, to have possessed these
curative qualities. Some, indeed, was of a malignant or deadly
character. Ariel, in "the Tempest," speaks of "the deep nook" in the
harbour</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="noin">May not this dew superstition have relationship, in some of its phases,
to the classic myth of Kephalos (the head of the sun), Procris (the
dew), and E&ocirc;s (the east or morning)? Mr. Cox says "it sprung from
three simple phrases, one of which said, 'The sun loves the dew;'
while the second said that 'the morning loves the sun;' and the third
added that 'the sun killed the dew.'" Hence both the good and
evil influences attendant thereon.</p>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> county of Lancaster especially has been famous for its
witches&mdash;or infamous, rather, if the reader prefer the latter epithet.
Certainly, the hanging of the poor old women from Pendle side, for
their supposed sorcery, is neither a legislative nor a judicial feat to
feel very proud of, especially in these days of "spirit-rapping
mediums" and dark <i>s&eacute;ance</i> performers, who supply writing done by
invisible hands, and cause heads to be thumped by malignant imps
in the shape of discordant fiddles, trumpets, and tambourines. This
modern necromancery, it must not be forgotten, is performed under
aristocratic patronage, and <i>for a monetary consideration</i> which would
have rejoiced greatly the hearts that beat wildly beneath the weather-worn
skins of poor old Dame Demdike and her compeers. Truly,
popular superstition, as well as tradition, is "tough." Forms, manners,
and customs may change externally, but it requires the lapse
of long, long periods of time to totally eradicate from the imagination
of an entire people <i>all faith</i> in any mystery, however absurd to modern
scientific minds, to which their ancestors once clung with simple
earnest truthfulness. The witchcraft of the old Demdike and Chattox
school, in all its essential features, is derived from the early
superstitions of our Eastern Aryan progenitors. Nay, the mystical
character of many of its more vulgar "stage properties," such as cauldrons,
besoms, sieves, hares, cats, &amp;c., was recorded with all due
solemnity in the Rig Vedas of the Southern Aryans, some three
thousand two hundred years ago. Pliny says that, in his day, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Britons celebrated magic rites with so many similar ceremonies that
one might suppose them to have been instructed therein by the Persians.
In the Britain of our day, after passing through both Keltic,
Teutonic, Greek, and Roman channels, these superstitions yet exist
either in the traditionary lore of the rustic population, or the more
elevated art forms with which poetry, sculpture, and painting have
clothed them. The diamond crystal and the charred willow branch
are near relatives of the carbon family; and it may truly be said that
a similar relationship exists between the weird "folk lore" of the
wild moorlands or the lonely mountain glens and the noble artistic
creations of a Shakspere, a Walter Scott, an Ovid, a Homer, an
Apelles, or a Phidias. Truly, "one touch of Nature makes the whole
world kin," and especially if that touch be given by a finger which has
been dipped deeply in the dark pool of mysticism.</p>

<p>Witches appear, on the whole, and in more modern times especially,
to typify evil or malignant influences, and are not unfrequently
degraded forms of the deities of a preceding mythology. Kelly, on
the authority of Schwartz and others, speaks of the "human witches"
of Northern nations as "degenerate and abhorred representatives of
the ancient goddesses and their attendants, who were themselves
developments of the primitive conception of the <i>cloud-women</i>; but
witches, even in their degraded state, exhibit a multitude of characteristics
by which we can recognise the originals of whom they are
but loathsome caricatures. Their alleged May-day meetings, for
instance, on the Brocken, the Blocksberg, and at Lucken Hare, in
the Eildon Hills, are not, as commonly supposed, merely reminiscences
of certain popular gatherings in heathen times, but were
originally assemblages of goddesses and their retinues, making their
customary progress through the land at the opening of the spring,
and visible to their believing votaries in the shifting clouds about the
summits of the mountains. Even the May-day night dances of the
witches, with the devil for the master of the ceremonies in the shape
of a buck goat, are but coarse representations of weather tokens of the
early spring; they are analogous in all but their ugliness to the
dances of the nymphs, led by the goat-footed Pan at the same glad
season of the year amongst the clouds on the windy mountain tops of
Arcadia." The witch revelling at Alloway Kirk, as detailed in several
Scottish traditions, and rendered immortal by the genius of Burns,
seems to confirm this view.</p>

<p>Amongst the infernal deities of classical mythology were the Fates
or Destinies, named Parc&aelig;. They were, like Shakspere's weird sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
three in number, and are said by some to have been the offspring of
Erebus and Nox, and by others of Jupiter and Themis. Their mode
of divination was a spinning process. When determining the future
life or career of a mortal, Clotho held the distaff, while Lachesis
did the spinning and Atropos cut the thread. According to Ovid,
these divining deities were equally successful in their occult labours
when without, as when with, some necessary "staple" on which to
exercise their spinning ingenuity or skill.</p>

<p>Witches were supposed to compass the death of any obnoxious
individual by making an image of the victim in wax. As this slowly
melted before a fire, or under other applied heat, it was believed the
original would in like manner sicken and decay. Images were
frequently formed of other materials, and maltreated in some
form or other, to produce similar results. This superstition yet
obtains to a great extent in the East and elsewhere. Dubois, in his
"People of India," speaks of magicians who make small images in
mud or clay, and write the names of the objects of their animosity
on the breasts thereof. These are afterwards pierced with thorns or
otherwise mutilated, "so as to communicate a corresponding injury
to the person represented."</p>

<p>There is considerable affinity, in this phase of the superstition, to
the classic solar myth which records the doom of Meleager. The
M&#339;r&aelig;, the three sisters, or the Fates, informed Alth&aelig;a, the mother
of the future hero, when in his cradle, that her son would die when
a certain brand they pointed out on the hearth was totally consumed.
She instantly snatched it away, plunged it into water, and hid it in
a secret place. In later years, Meleager slew a brother of Alth&aelig;a,
which so exasperated the mother that she laid her curse upon her
son. She brought out the brand from its hiding place, and flung it
on the fire. As it burnt away, the strength of the hero decayed,
and, with the extinguishing of its last spark, he expired. Mr. Cox
says Meleager's life is that "of the sun, which is bound up with the
torch of day; when the torch burns out he dies."</p>

<p>The gradual change of the old Aryan superstition into its more
modern form would seem to be indicated by a passage in the writings
of Pomponius Mela, who flourished in the reign of the Emperor
Claudius. The old writer, describing what his translator terms a
"Druidical nunnery," says it "was situated in an island in the
British sea, and contained nine of these <i>venerable vestals</i>, who pretended
that they could raise storms and tempests by their incantations,
could cure the most incurable diseases, could transform
themselves into all kinds of animals, and foresee future events."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald Scot, in his "Discoverie of Witchcraft," published in
1584, describes the nature of the faith in this superstition as it
existed in his day, and for ridiculing which he was covered with
obloquy, and his book was not only "refuted" by King James I. and a
host of others, but it was ignominiously consigned to the flames by
the hands of the common hangman. This shrewd old writer says:</p>

<p>"No one endued with common sense but will deny that the elements
are obedient to witches and at their commandment, or that
they may, at their pleasure, send rain, hail, tempests, thunder,

stone over her left shoulder towards the west, or hurleth a little sea
sand up into the element, or wetteth a broom-sprig in water, and

putting water therein, stirreth it about with her finger; or boileth
hogs' bristles; or layeth sticks across upon a bank where never was
a drop of water; or burieth sage till it be rotten; all which things
are confessed by witches, and affirmed by writers to be the means
that witches used to move extraordinary tempests and rain."</p>

<p>The elaborate title-page of this curious work, vividly illustrates the
condition of the public mind on this subject in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries:&mdash;"Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft; Familiars;

R. C. and are to be sold by Giles Calvert dwelling at the Black
Spread-Eagle, at the West-End of Pauls, 1651."</p>

<p>Wierus, a German physician, indeed, in 1563, published a work,
in which he undertook the refutation of many of the so-called facts
and phenomena which were believed to pertain to witchcraft, but he
apparently dared not to venture a direct denial of the existence of
sorcery or demoniacal possession. He, however, did much, considering
the conditions by which he was surrounded. He thanked
God that his labour had not been in vain, but that it had "in many
places caused the cruelty against innocent blood to slacken." He
claimed, and certainly deserved, the civic wreath, for having saved
the lives of so many of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Doubtless, in addition to the genuine superstition, there existed, as
at the present time, a certain amount of imposture in connection
therewith, although, owing to the heavy penalties inflicted by the
law, the credulous element may be supposed to have largely preponderated.
It is somewhat remarkable that the celebrated Pendle
witches, Demdike, Chattox, &amp;c., were pronounced <i>genuine</i> sorcerers,
and were hanged accordingly, at Lancaster, in the year 1612; while
the eight from Samlesbury, near Preston, were acquitted, because
they were suspected to be not the <i>genuine</i> article, but a fraudulent
imitation thereof.</p>

<p>So thoroughly saturated was the public mind with a belief in witchcraft,
until a relatively recent period, that hundreds were yearly
executed for this supposed crime. Howell, in his "State Trials,"
estimates that, in one hundred and fifty years, thirty thousand
persons suffered death as witches in England alone!</p>

<p>Bishop Jewel, when preaching a sermon before Queen Elizabeth,
exhorted her Majesty to use her authority to check the "tremendous
operations of the devil by exterminating his agents, the witches and
wizards, who were then very numerous."</p>

<p>Reginald Scot gives us a very graphic full-length portrait of the
devil of popular superstition in the sixteenth century. He says,
"Our mothers' mayds terrifie us with the ouglie devil, with hornes
on his head, fier in his mouth, a huge tayle in his breach, eies like
basons, fangs like a boar, claws like a tiger, a skin like a bear, and a
voice roaring like a lion."</p>

<p>A Keltic hairy wood-demon was called <i>Dus</i>, hence our modern "the
Deuce." A similar Teutonic monster was named <i>Scrat</i>, hence our
"Old Scratch."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1633, seventeen Pendle witches were condemned to die; but
Charles I. pardoned them. Strange as it may appear, some of
them confessed themselves guilty. Such is the fascinating influence
of superstition, that imposture itself gradually yields to its power.
There is an old Lancashire saying that if a man will only tell a lie
a certain number of times he will eventually himself regard it as a
truth. One of the seventeen Pendle witches last referred to, Margaret
Johnson, in her confession said, "Good Friday is one constant day
for a generall meetinge of witches, and that on Good Friday last
they had a generall meetinge neere Pendle Water syde." One of
the Samlesbury "impostors," a girl named Grace Sowerbutts, stated
that she had been induced to join the sisterhood, and she gave an
account of the means adopted to acquire the diabolical potency, which,
it appears, was not considered satisfactory by the judges, even of
that day. Flying over Ribble with their "familiars" was one of the
ordinary feats of the gang, according to this youthful witch. Perhaps
Grace's face wanted the orthodox number of wrinkles to gain her
credence in an affair of so much mystery and importance at that
period.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of this species of delusion occurred at
Salem, in New England, in 1682. During the excitement which prevailed
in Massachusetts at this time, about twenty persons were put
to death for witchcraft. One woman confessed that she had ridden
from Andover to a witch meeting on a broomstick. She added that
the stick broke, and that the lameness under which she at the time
suffered resulted from the accident. Her daughter and grand-daughter
confirmed her evidence, and declared they all signed
Satan's book together. Others confessed to equally strange delusions.
And yet, it appears the inhabitants of Rhode Island formed an exception
to the rule, for they declared "there were no witches on
earth, nor devils,&mdash;except the New England ministers, and such
as they!"</p>

<p>Hallam notices a parallel case of delusion recorded in the "Memoirs
of Du Clercq," which happened at Arras, in 1459. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A few obscure persons were accused of '<i>vauderie</i>, or witchcraft.'
After their condemnation, which was founded on confessions obtained
by torture, and afterwards retracted, an epidemical contagion of
superstitious dread was diffused all around. Numbers were arrested,
burned alive, by order of a tribunal instituted for the detection of
this offence, or detained in prison; so that no person in Arras thought
himself safe. It was believed that many were accused for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of their possessions, which were confiscated to the use of the church.
At length the Duke of Burgundy interfered, and put a stop to the
persecutions."</p>

<p>That the fraudulent element most probably entered largely into
the motives of witch prosecutions is attested by some instances in
connection with the Lancashire trials. Mr. Crossley, in the republication
of "Potts's Discovery of Witches," by the Chetham Society,
says "the main interest in reviewing this miserable band of victims
will be felt to centre in Alice Nutter. Wealthy, well-conducted,
well-connected, and placed probably on an equality with most of the
neighbouring families, and the magistrates before whom she was
committed, she deserves to be distinguished from the companions
with whom she suffered, and to attract an attention which has never
yet been directed to her. That James Dervice, on whose evidence
she was convicted, was instructed to accuse her by her own nearest
relatives, and that the magistrate, Roger Nowell, entered as a confederate
into the conspiracy against her on account of a long-disputed
boundary, are allegations which tradition has preserved, but the
truth or falsehood of which, at this distance of time, it is scarcely
possible satisfactorily to examine. Her mansion, Rough Lee, is still
standing, a very substantial and rather fine specimen of the houses
of the inferior gentry, <i>temp.</i> James I., but now divided into cottages."</p>

<p>It was likewise suspected by the magistrates that a seminary priest,
named Thompson, <i>alias</i> Southworth, had instigated the girl Sowerbutts
to make the charges in the Samlesbury case previously referred
to.</p>

<p>Some excuse for the popular frenzy on the subject may be found
in the fact that not only did the king and the highest legal authorities
in the land recognise the crimes of sorcery and witchcraft, but
dignitaries of the church, like Bishop Jewel, in Elizabeth's reign,
complained of the great increase in the number of those offenders.
Such men as Sir Thomas Brown, indeed, went so far as to stigmatise
the sceptical on the subject as guilty of atheism.</p>

<p>Sir Kenelm Digby seems to have doubted. Nevertheless, in his
"Observations on the Religio Medici," after expressing his doubts, he
adds:&mdash;"Neither do I deny there are witches; I only reserve my
assent till I meet with stronger motives to carry it." Sir Kenelm,
however, notwithstanding his scepticism about witchcraft, could
swallow tolerably large doses of the marvellous. In a letter to J.
Winthorp, jun., governor of New England, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For all sorts of agues, I have of late tried the following magnetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
experiment with infallible success. Pare the patient's nails when the
fit is coming on, and put the parings into a little bag of fine linen or
sarsanet, and tie that about a live eel's neck in a tub of water. The
eel will die and the patient will recover. And if a dog or hog eat
that eel they will also die."</p>

<p>He adds, "I have known one that cured all deliriums and frenzies
whatsoever, and at once taking, with an elixer made of dew, nothing
but dew purified and nipped up in a glass and digested 15 months
till all of it has become a grey powder, not one drop of humidity
remaining. This I know to be true, and that first it was as black as
ink, then green, then grey, and at 22 months' end it was as white
and lustrous as any oriental pearl. But it cured manias at fifteen
months' end."</p>

<p>The sapient James I., of England, before he left his northern
kingdom, was so profoundly agitated on hearing the rumour that
one Agnes Sampson and two hundred other Scotch witches "had
sailed in sieves from Leith to North Berwick church to hold a
banquet with the devil," that he ordered the wretched woman
to be put to the torture in his presence, and appeared to feel
pleasure in questioning her during her suffering. It was afterwards
affirmed that Agnes and her two hundred weird sisters "had
baptised and drowned a black cat, thereby raising a dreadful
storm," which had nearly proved fatal to a ship that carried the
superstitious monarch. The poor woman, though she protested her
innocence to the last, perished at the stake, supplicating in vain for
mercy from the king and her Christian fellow-subjects. Strange
to say, the second batch of witches condemned at Lancaster in 1633,
but pardoned by Charles I., were accused of similarly interfering
with the weather during a royal cruise. A letter in the State Paper
Office, written May 16, 1634, by Sir William Pelham to Lord
Conway, contains the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The greatest news from the country is of a huge pack of witches
which are lately discovered in Lancashire, whereof 'tis said 19 are
condemned, and that there are at least 60 already discovered, and yet
daily there are more revealed: there are divers of them of good
ability, and they have done much harm. I hear it is suspected that
they had a hand in raising the great storm, wherein his Majesty
[Charles I.] was in so great danger at sea in Scotland."</p>

<p>The writer of the article "Hertfordshire," in "Knight's Cyclop&aelig;dia,"
has the following singular reference to the belief in witchcraft
in that part of England, about the middle of last century:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"There has been no public event since (<i>temp.</i> Charles I.) of any
moment connected with the county; but a circumstance which
occurred in April of the year 1751, deserves notice as marking the
extent of popular ignorance and barbarity at that period. A publican
near Tring being troubled with fits, conceived that he was bewitched
by an old woman named Osborne. Notice was given by the crier
that two witches were to be tried by ducking; and in consequence a
vast mob assembled at the time appointed. The old woman and her
husband, who had been in Tring workhouse, were removed into the
church for safety; but the mob obtained possession of the old man
and the old woman, whom they then dragged two miles to a muddy
stream, ducked them and otherwise so maltreated them that the
woman died on the spot, and the man with difficulty recovered.
Thomas Colley, one of the perpetrators, was executed on the spot;
but so strong was the infatuation of the populace, that it was thought
necessary to have a guard of more than 100 troopers to escort the
cavalcade to the place of execution."</p>

<p>Yes, the ignorance and infatuation had ceased to be "respectable,"
which fact, doubtless, has a marvellous influence on our mental and
moral optics, when contemplating many other historical delusions, as
well as those connected with supposed witches and their malevolent
doings.</p>

<p>A singular instance of combined delusion and imposture with respect
to witchcraft, is related in Ralph Gardiner's "malicious invective
against the government of Newcastle-on-Tyne," entitled "England's
Grievance Discovered in Relation to the Coal-Trade," and published
in 1655. It appears that about five or six years previously, the
magistrates of the borough had sent two of their sergeants into Scotland,
"to agree with a Scotchman, who pretended knowledge to
find out Witches by pricking them with pins, to come to Newcastle,
where he should try such who should be brought to him, and to have
twenty shillings a peece for all he could condemn as witches, and
free passage thither and back again." Many poor women were subjected
to much indignity by this fellow, who caused them to be
stripped partially naked, when he inserted pins into various parts
of their flesh, to find a place from which no blood would issue, as he
pretended. On one occasion, however, he was detected and compelled
to acknowledge that a respectable woman, whom he had grossly
treated and condemned, was "not a child of the Devil," as he had
previously insisted. It appears that this worthy afterwards visited
other parts of Northumberland, "to try women there, where he got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
some three pound a peece." The author adds, "it was conceived if
he had staid he would have made most of the women in the North
Witches for mony." He gives the names of fifteen poor wretches
who were hanged at Newcastle at this impostor's instigation, and
says, "These poor souls never confessed anything, but pleaded
innocence: And one of them by name Margaret Brown beseeched
God that some remarkable sign might be seen at the time of their
execution, to evidence their innocence, and as soon as ever she was
turned off the ladder, <i>her blood gushed out upon the people to the admiration
of the beholders</i>!" The said witchfinder at length met with the
fate he so richly merited. He was, in the words of the indignant
author, "laid hold on in Scotland, cast into prison, indicted, arraigned,
and condemned for such like villainie exercised in Scotland.
And upon the gallows he confessed he had been the death of about
two hundred and twenty women in England and Scotland for the
gain of twenty shillings a peece, and beseeched forgiveness. And
was executed." Singularly enough, our author himself met with a
similar untimely fate, but for a very different crime, as appears from
the following MS. note, in the copy of Gardiner's work before the
present writer, purporting to be extracted from a "MS. Life of
Barnes, p. 420":&mdash;"Upon some methods agreed on for reformation
of Manners in the Town according to that clause in the charter
which empowers them to make By-laws, there was one Gardiner writ
a malicious Invective against the Government of Newcastle, but he
got his Reward, being afterwards at York hanged for Coyning."</p>

<p>The celebrated "witchfinder," Hopkins, was equally unfortunate
with his Scotch compeer. Some individuals, with more acumen than
the superstitious masses, took it into their heads to experiment upon
Hopkins himself. Accordingly they seized him, tied his thumbs and
toes together, after his own fashion, when operating on others. On
placing him on the water he swam as buoyantly as his victims.
"This," says one writer, "cleared the country of him, and it was a
great pity that they did not think of the experiment sooner."
Hopkins's method of discovering witches is, at least, as old as the
days of Pliny the elder.</p>

<p>In the "Covntrey Ivstice," by "Michael Dalton, Lincoln's Inn,
Gent," published in 1618, are some curious illustrations of the
state of the law with regard to witchcraft, at the period. The
author says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now against these witches the Iustices of peace may not alwaies
expect direct euidence, seeing all their works are the works of darknesse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and no witnesses present with them to accuse them: And
therefore for their better discouerie, I thought good here to insert
certaine obseruations out of the booke of discouery of the Witches
that were arraigned at Lancaster, <i>Ann. Dom.</i> 1612, before Sir <i>Iames
Altham</i>, and Sir <i>Edw. Bromely</i> Iudges of Assise there.</p>

<p>"1. They haue ordinarily a familiar, or spirit, which appeareth
to them.</p>

<p>"2. Their said familiar hath some bigg or place vpon their body,
where he sucketh them.</p>

<p>"3. They haue often pictures of clay, or waxe (like a man, &amp;c.)
found in their house.</p>

<p>"4. If the dead body bleed, vpon the Witches touching it.</p>

<p>"5. The testimony of the person hurt, vpon his death.</p>

<p>"6. The examination and confession of the children or servants
of the Witch.</p>

<p>"7. Their owne voluntary confession, which exceeds all other
euidence."</p>

<p>Bodin, a French writer, in his "Demonomanie des Sorciers,"
published in 1587, says, "On half-proof or strong presumption, the
judge may proceed to torture." The judge might, moreover, in his
opinion, lie with impunity, and promise a suspected person a pardon
on confession, without the intention of carrying it into effect. But
this is not much from a man, who could cite with approval and even
relish, the decision of a magistrate that a person "who had eaten flesh
on a Friday should be burned alive unless he repented, and if he
repented, yet he was hanged out of compassion." Yet this same
Bodin was a Protestant, forsooth!</p>

<p>Walburgar, writing in the following century, is not much less tolerant
of judicial mendacity. He does not, indeed, recommend direct
lying, but equivocation. The judge may inform the suspected that
her confession will induce in him favourable action, that a new
house should be built for her, and that it will tend to the saving of
her life. And yet, after the poor deluded creature has committed
herself, he regards it as perfectly just and honourable that the
sapient administrator of the law should inform her that his action in
burning her will be favourable to the commonwealth, that her new
house will be of wood at the stake, and that the destruction of her
body will tend to the salvation of her soul!</p>

<p>In W&uuml;rtzburg, as recently as 1749, a girl was burnt alive as a
legally condemned practitioner of witchcraft. Witches were burned
in Scotland till 1772, and in France in 1718. The severe acts passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in the reign of James I., condemnatory of witchcraft, were not repealed
till the 9th George II. (1736).</p>

<p>There appears to have been three kinds of witches&mdash;the black, the
white, and the grey. The black had power only for evil, the white
for good, and the grey possessed authority both in matters good and
evil. These seem to have originally been merely personifications of
the black, white, and grey-coloured clouds of the Aryan elemental
conflicts. Perhaps Shakspere formed his principal group of three
from the circumstance that the destiny of his hero was influenced to
some extent by one of each class. Many altars, of the period of the
Roman occupation, dedicated to the <i>de&aelig; matres</i>, or mother goddesses,
have been found in various parts of the north of England. It is
believed they were introduced by Teutonic auxiliaries. These deities
have undergone much change in their transference to more modern
superstitions; but some of their attributes may be detected without
difficulty. Mr. Thomas Wright, in "Celt, Roman, and Saxon," says:</p>

<p>"They are sometimes regarded as the three Fates&mdash;the <i>norni</i> of
the north, the <i>w&aelig;leyrian</i> of the Anglo-Saxons (the weird sisters, transformed
in Shakspere into three witches) disposing of the fates of
individuals, and dealing out life and death. But they are also found
distributing rewards and punishments, giving wealth and property,
and conferring fruitfulness. They are the three fairies who are often
introduced in the fairy legends of a later period, with these same
characteristics."</p>

<p>I have said that many of the "theatrical properties" of medi&aelig;val
witchcraft may be traced to an Aryan origin. The chief of these, the
cauldron, is familiar to all from Shakspere's admirable pictures in
Macbeth. I have previously referred to the fact that the phrase
"brewing a storm" is derived from this source. Cauldron stories are
common amongst ancient tribes. Guy of Warwick's "porridge pot"
is of this class. Kelly says, speaking of the "genii of the lightning,
the beings who brewed and lightned in the storm,"&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the Bhrigus or their associates were brewers they must needs
have had brewing utensils; at the very least they must have had a
brewing pot; and therefore we are justified in referring back the origin
of the witches' cauldron to the remotest antiquity. Perhaps the oldest
example of such a vessel of which there is any distinct record is the
cauldron which Thor carried off from the giant Hymir, to brew
drink for the gods at Oegir's harvest feast. It was five miles deep,
and modern expounders of the Eddic myths are of opinion that it
was the vaulted sky."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the "heavenly liquor," so much
vaunted, was neither more nor less than rain water, "brewed" by the
action of the storm deities and their assistants, whether dignified by
the name of soma, amrita, or nectar.</p>

<p>Robert Hunt, in his "Superstitions of Old Cornwall," describes
the <i>modus operandi</i> of a celebrated witch at Fraddam, when engaged
in brewing a liquor of "wondrous potency," which clearly exhibits the
"elemental strife" that lies at the base of these superstitions. She
"collected with the utmost care all the deadly things she could obtain,
with which to brew her famous drink. In the darkest night, in the
midst of the wildest storms, amidst the flashings of lightnings and
the bellowings of the thunder, the witch was seen riding on her black
ram-cat over the moors and mountains in search of her poisons. At
length all was complete&mdash;the horse-drink was boiled, the hell-broth
was brewed. It was in March, about the time of the equinox; the
night was dark, and the King of Storms was abroad."</p>

<p>Olaus Magnus speaks of the storm-raising powers and propensities
of the Scandinavian witches as amongst their most remarkable
attributes.</p>

<p>The sieve, amongst all nations of the Aryan stock, and even of
some others, has been regarded as a mythical implement of this class.
Witches used them as boats, notwithstanding their inability to float
on water. The supernatural, of course, easily overcame so trifling a
physical difficulty. The premier weird woman in Shakspere's
group, referring to the scoff she had received from a sailor's wife,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master of the Tiger;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>in a sieve I'll thither sail</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a rat without a tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll do, I'll do, I'll do.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not improbable that witch-sailing would be originally through
the air rather than on the water. The sieve, amongst the Aryans,
was a cloud emblem; the implement by means of which water was
filtered into rain-drops. The upper regions were more affected by
witches than the oceanic "waste of waters." In the opening scene
in Macbeth, the well-known trio, at the conclusion of their <i>s&eacute;ance</i>,
"hover through the fog and filthy air." They appear to have intimate
relationship to the clouds and the weather:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>1st Witch</i>&mdash;When shall we three meet again,<br /></span>

<p class="noin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Though unable to totally wreck the seaman's bark, the first witch
assures her companions that "it shall be tempest toss'd." When
Banquo asks Macbeth, "Whither are they vanished?" the latter

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Into the air; and what seemed corporal melted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As breath into the wind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">In his letter to his wife, he likewise observes: "They made themselves&mdash;air,
into which they vanished." Hecate, in the third act,
after giving instructions to the weird host, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm for the air; this night I'll spend<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As by the strength of their illusion,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="noin">And previous to departing, Hecate further says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hark, I am called; my little spirit, see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sits in a foggy cloud</i>, and stays for me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Hecate, in the classical mythology, is the Pandemonium name for
Diana. This goddess was known by the latter appellation on earth,
and by that of Luna in heaven. Hence the absurdity of converting
her into a burly masculine basso in the so-called "Locke's music,"
introduced with very questionable taste into Shakspere's sublime
tragedy of Macbeth. Proserpina, the wife of Pluto, is confounded
with Hecate. She was supposed to preside over sorceries and incantations.</p>

<p>Grimm, although he, in one of his tales, speaks of "angels drawing
water in a perforated vessel," seems not to have clearly interpreted
the mythic import of the sieve. He, however, expressly says that it
"appears to be a sacred archaic implement to which marvellous
powers were attributed." Liebrecht speaks of a tribe of water-spirits,
or cloud-gods, the Draci of Languedoc, with "hands perforated like
colanders." The Grecian Naiads, with their urns, and the various
river-gods, from old Tiber or Ilissus to Father Thames, are but more
artistic modifications of a similar thought.</p>

<p>There is a tradition, in the neighbourhood of Grimsargh, near
Preston, to the effect that during some drought, "in the olden time,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a gigantic dun cow appeared and gave an almost unlimited supply of
milk, which saved the inhabitants from death. An old woman&mdash;of
the witch fraternity, I suspect&mdash;however, with the view to obtain from
the beast more than the usual number of pails-full, milked the cow with
a sieve, riddle, or colander, which, of course, never became full, as the
precious liquid passed through the orifices into a vessel below. When
full, the latter was replaced by an empty one of a similar character.
The tradition adds that the cow either died of grief, on detecting the
imposture, or from sheer exhaustion, I forget which. A locality is
still pointed out, named "Cow Hill," where gossips aver that, in
relatively recent times, the huge bones of the said cow were disinterred.
Over the porch of a house on the way from Goosnargh to
Longridge, I remember, not very long ago, seeing a large bone,
apparently a rib, placed in a conspicuous position. This was stated
to have been a portion of the skeleton so disinterred. I fancied at
the time that, in Polonius's phraseology, the bone in question was
suggestive of something "very like a whale." It is not improbable,
however, that at some early period, the remains of the huge extinct
ox, the <i>bos primigenius</i>, or even the <i>elephas primigenius</i> or fossil mammoth,
may have been exhumed in the neighbourhood of Grimsargh.
Many bones and skulls of the former have been dredged from the bed
of the Ribble, and others taken from the fluvial drift excavated in
the valley when preparing for the foundations of the piers of the railway
bridges in the neighbourhood of Preston. Bones of two species of
fossil elephant, two species of rhinoceros, and other extinct pachyderms
of huge dimensions, have recently been found in connection
with early flint implements, indicative of the presence of man, in
the fresh water gravel belonging to what Lyell terms the post-pliocene
period of the earth's history, both in France and in several
parts of England. Some such discovery, grafted upon the ancient
Aryan tradition respecting the heavenly cows, or rain-giving clouds,
opportunely rescuing the parched vegetation from premature decay,
might very easily eventuate in such a tradition as the one current
in Grimsargh at the present day.</p>

<p>Some of the deeds of the Saxon giant, the celebrated Guy of
Warwick, appear to enshrine elements of myths of a similar character.
In the "Huddersford Wiccamical Chaplet," we read:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>We have here the cow, or rain cloud, the boar, typical of the
lightning, and the human giant or warrior substitute for Indra or
Odin, in the Aryan and Teutonic mythologies.</p>

<p>The ribs of the gigantic dun cow, said to have been slain by the
redoubtable Guy, are still preserved at Warwick. A similar rib is
to be seen in the church of St. Mary Redcliffe, at Bristol, and
another at Chesterfield. At an inn in Lincolnshire, a huge scapula
is exhibited as a relic of the famous dun cow. The tradition at
Bristol asserts that, at some former period, the said bovine monster
supplied the whole of the city with milk. This coincides with the
Grimsargh tradition. One Warwick legend too asserts that the cow had
been driven mad by the overmilking of a witch. Another says that
the cow was slain by Guy during a season of great scarcity, and that
the consumption of its flesh saved the inhabitants from perishing of
famine. The large rib in the Foljambe Chapel, Warwick, is said to
measure seven feet four inches in length, and from twelve to thirteen
inches in circumference. Frank Buckland, in his "Curiosities of
Natural History," says, "the ribs of the dun cow at Warwick and
the gigantic rib at St. Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol, are the
bones of whales."</p>

<p>Tom Brown ("Amusements for the Meridian of London," 1700)
mentions a remarkable superstitious reverence for the milk of a red
cow. Referring to the Green Walk, St. James's Park, London, he
says: "There were a cluster of senators talking of state affairs, and
the price of corn and cattle, and were disturbed with the noisy Milk
folk crying: 'A can of Milk, ladies; a can of <i>Red</i> Cow's Milk, sirs?'
This appears to be a remnant of the Aryan reverence for the heavenly
fire or the lightning, which they believed to be typified in the <i>red</i>
breast of the robin, the red mutch of the woodpecker, and the red
colour of other 'fire-bringers.'"</p>

<p>In the Vedas, the dawn is symbolised by the goddess Ushas, by
philologists regarded as the prototype of the Greek E&ocirc;s, and the
Latin Aurora. The ruddy light on the eastern horizon which preceded
the sunrise, was regarded as a herd of red cows attendant upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her. In the Vedic hymns she is sometimes addressed as a quail.
Kelly says, "Vartik&acirc;, the Sanscrit name of the bird, corresponds
etymologically with ortyx, its Greek name; and in the myths of
Greece and Asia Minor the quail is a symbol of light and heat."</p>

<p>The early Greek mythology has preserved some remains of this
bovine personification of the ruddy dawn clouds. Mr. Gladstone, in
"Juventus Mundi," says, "Although animal worship has played so
considerable a part in the religions of the East, the traces of it in
Homer are few, and, with one exception, they are also faint. That
exception is the extraordinary sanctity attaching, in the Twelfth
Odyssey, to the Oxen of the Sun, which I have treated as belonging
to the Ph&#339;nician system, and as foreign to the Olympian religion."
Notwithstanding this, the evidence in favour of the Aryan origin
of the myth seems indisputable. Dr. Benisch, in one of his expositions
of "Maimonides and Kimchito" to members of the Society of
Hebrew Literature, on the 30th of March, 1871, stated that he was
engaged in a comparison of the Semitic and Aryan tongues, with a
view to establish many more points of contact than are usually
admitted to exist between these two families of speech.</p>

<p>Red cow's milk is an important element in a recipe for the cure of
consumption in Dr. Sampson Jones's "Medicine Boke," published in
the latter portion of the seventeenth century. <i>Red</i> is especially
mentioned as the colour of the heifer set apart for sacrifice for the
purification of sin in Numbers, chapter 19; and <i>scarlet</i> is specified as
the colour of one of the articles "cast into the midst of the burning
of the heifer." Thousands of persons yet believe that there is more
warmth in <i>red</i> flannel than in either black, white, blue, or yellow.</p>

<p>On some public-house signs it is not uncommon to refer to the
liquor sold within as the "dun cow's milk." On one, between York
and Durham, we read the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, come you from the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, come you from the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye will taste the Dun Cow's milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y'll say it is the best.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Durham legend of St. Cuthbert's dun cow is well known in the
North of England. The eccentric saint would not permit a cow to
approach his sacred residence at Lindisfarne. He excused himself
for this strange freak by averring that "where there is a cow there
must be a woman, and where there is a woman there must be
mischief." Has not the Scotchman's "mountain dew" some
figurative relationship to the Aryan heavenly soma?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>A belief in the influence of witches on the milk and butter yielding
habits of cows is yet very widely entertained. In his "Ancient and
Modern Manners of the Irish," Camden says: "If a cow becomes dry
a witch is applied to, who, inspiring her with a fondness for some
other calf, makes her yield her milk." He further observes that they
slaughter all hares found amongst their cattle on May-day, from a
belief that they are witches, who, having designs on their butter, have
assumed this form the better to effect their purpose. Other authorities
speak of the general belief in witches sucking the dugs of cows in
the form of hares. A writer in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, as recently as 1846,
refers to a certain Scotch witch, who, he says, "has been seen a
hundred times milking the cows in the shape of a hare." A Scotch
witch, recently deceased, named Margery Scott, firmly believed that
she had been frequently transmuted into a hare and hunted by dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hunt, in his "Drolls, Superstitions, and Traditions of
Old Cornwall," relates a very amusing story about "the witch of
Treva." Being without food, the husband of the old crone, who
doubted her pretended supernatural power, asked, as a proof to which
he would yield, that she would walk to St. Ives and back, a distance
of five miles, and procure some substantial human victuals. This
she undertook to effect in the space of half-an-hour. The man kept
his eye on her for some time, after she started on her strange errand,
"and at the bottom of the hill he saw his wife quietly place herself on
the ground and disappear. In her place <i>a fine hare</i> ran on at its full
speed." He further adds that the woman returned within the prescribed
time, and brought with her "good flesh and taties, all ready for
aiting!" When the said crone was carried to her grave, she caused
much amazement and even terror by her mad pranks. "When they
were about half way between the house and the church, a hare started
from the roadside and leaped over the coffin. The terrified bearers let
the corpse fall to the ground, and ran away. Another lot of men took
up the coffin and proceeded. They had not gone far when puss was
suddenly seen seated on the coffin, and again the coffin was abandoned."
After considerable labour and much tribulation, we are informed the
parson commenced "the ordinary burial service, and there stood the
hare, which, as soon as the clergyman began 'I am the resurrection
and the life,' uttered a diabolical howl, changed into a black, unshapen
creature, and disappeared!"</p>

<p>One of the Saxon forms of the goddess Freyja, according to Mannhardt,
has hares for trainbearers, and another walks at night in the
fields of Aargau, accompanied by a hare of silver-grey colour. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
prevalent superstition that a hare crossing the highway before any
person prognosticated ill-fortune, doubtless, has its origin in the
witchcraft association. Perhaps the story of the hare's nest, to
which children are sent in search of eggs at Easter, in Swabia and
Hesse, according to Meier, is the original of our "<i>mare's nest</i>," and
has some reference to the supposed supernatural attributes of the
animal. Mannhardt says the hare is reputed to be a fire and soul
bringer; that many kinder-br&uuml;nnen (baby fountains) are so named
from this circumstance; and that children are supposed to be procured
from the hare's form, as well as from the parsley bed. We
learn from C&aelig;sar that the Ancient Britons held the hare in reverence,
and refused, therefore, to kill it for food.</p>

<p>Sir Jno. Lubbock, Lyell and others are of opinion that to the
existence of this feeling may be attributed the almost total
absence of the bones of the hare amongst the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the ancient
Swiss lake dwellings, and the kj&ouml;kkenm&ouml;ddings or shell mounds
of Denmark. The superstition yet exists amongst the Laplanders
of the present day. According to Burton, the Somal Arabs reject
it as the Hottentot men do, although their women may partake of it
as food, and M. Schlegel informs us that the Chinese entertain a
prejudice against the animal. Owing to a false impression respecting
the hare chewing its cud, the Jews pronounced it to be unclean, and
therefore rejected it as food. Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, when
she had harangued her soldiers, opened the drapery around her
bosom and let go a hare, which she had concealed. The frightened
animal's antics, according to the then orthodox laws of divination,
indicated a successful issue to the pending expedition. The warrior
queen improved the occasion, led her enthusiastic troops against the
highly disciplined Roman legions, and vanquished them.</p>

<p>Kelly is satisfied of the Aryan origin of the animal's supernatural
reputation. He says,&mdash;"The hare is no doubt mythically connected
with the phenomena of the sky, but upon what natural grounds it
has been credited with such meteoric relations is a point not yet
determined. I incline to think it will be found to lie, in part at least,
in the habits which the animal displays about the time of the vernal
equinox, and which have given rise to the popular saying, 'as mad
as a March hare.' And perhaps this very restlessness in rough
weather has been the cause of the animal being regarded as a disguised
witch, actively engaged in 'brewing storms.'"</p>

<p>Cats, as well as hares, have the reputation of being weather wise;
hence their association with witches or "wise women." Hecate was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
supposed to frequently assume the feline form. Shakspere's witches
evidently held it in reverence. One says, with great solemnity, on a
momentous occasion, "Thrice the brindled cat hath mew'd." A
very strong belief yet obtains, amongst persons better educated than
the Lancashire peasantry, that cats can see better in the dark than
in the light, and that they possess nine lives, or, in other words, that
they require killing nine times, before they remain permanently
defunct. The author of "Choice Notes" says that sailors have a
firm belief that the presence of a dead hare on board ship is certain
to bring about bad weather. They likewise object to having cats on
board, and when one happens to be more frisky than usual, like a
"mad March hare," they have a saying that "the cat has got a gale
of wind in her tail." The same authority says that the throwing of
a cat overboard will infallibly bring on a storm. Mannhardt says, in
Germany, anyone who, during his lifetime, may have made cats his
enemies, is certain to be accompanied to the grave with wind and
rain. A writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i> refers to a Dutch superstition of
this class, in which a rainy wedding day is supposed to result from
the bride's neglecting to feed her cat. Walter Kelly thinks "the
question why the chariot of the goddess Freyja was drawn by cats,
and why Holda was attended by maidens riding on cats, or themselves
disguised in feline form, is easily solved. Like the lynx, and
the owl of Pallas Athen&ecirc;, the cat owes its celestial honours above all to
its eyes, that gleam in the dark like fire, but the belief in its supernatural
powers may very probably have been corroborated by the
common observation that the cat, like the stormy boar, is a weather
wise animal."</p>

<p>This connection of the goddess Freyja (whence our Friday) with
the feline personification of stormy weather, may lay at the root of
the prejudice of sailors against commencing a voyage on that day.
That this superstition has yet strong hold on the nautical imagination,
was recently (1871), attested by the fact that, in consequence of the
loss of the ill-fated turret-ship, "Captain," which had left port on a
Friday, the "Agincourt," in order to satisfy the clamour of the crew,
did not leave Gibraltar on the presumedly fatal day. The departure
of the last-named war-ship on the Saturday, however, did not prevent
her striking on the "Pearl Rock" shortly afterwards. This fact
might, perhaps, stagger Jack's faith for a moment, but superstition
is tougher than actual experience in many of its phases, and Friday
will still be a black letter day in the sailor's calendar.</p>

<p>Hallam, in his "View of the State of Europe during the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Ages," when discussing the probabilities of the guilt or innocence of
the Knights Templars, concerning which there still exists great
diversity of opinion, refers to the evidence adduced by M. von
Hammer as the most difficult of refutation. This authority contends
that the adoption of the infamous practices of the Gnostic superstition,
which the Templars are said to have imported from the
East, is proved by certain obscene sculptures found in secret places in
edifices erected by the members of this order in various parts of Europe.
He says these scandalous figures resemble those in the Gnostic
churches. Hallam adds, however, "The Stadinghi, heretics of the
thirteenth century, are charged, in a bull of Gregory IX., with
exactly the same profaneness, even including the <i>black cat</i> [canis aut
gattus niger] as the Templars of the next century. This is said by
Von Hammer to be confirmed by sculptures." May not these coincidences
have arisen from the common Aryan origin of the pagan
superstitions; and, in some instances, at least, in the figurative
meaning of the sculptures referred to? There was a famous "cat
stone" in Leyland old church, which was said to be the "devil in the
form of a cat," who "throttled" an individual that witnessed his
removal, by night, of the stones used by the builders of the church
in the day-time. The morals, as well as the manners, of the thirteenth
century were very different to those of the nineteenth; and
yet I could point out, within Lancashire and Cheshire, at least two
instances, where obnoxious sculpture of this class has been preserved
from medi&aelig;val times to the present day.</p>

<p>The notorious besom or broomstick is an instrument in the operations
of witchcraft common to all the Aryan nations. According to
the "Asiatic Register," for 1801, the Eastern, as well as the European
witches, "practice their spells by dancing at midnight, and the
principal instrument they use on such occasions is a broom." It is
regarded as "a type of the winds, and therefore an appropriate
utensil in the hands of the witches, who are wind makers and
workers in that element."</p>

<p>Dr. Kuhn says, "In the Mark, an old broom is burned in order to
raise a wind. Sailors, after long toiling against a contrary wind, on
meeting another ship sailing in an opposite direction, will throw an
old broom before the vessel, which, they contend, will reverse the
wind, and consequently cause it to blow in their favour."</p>

<p>Burns, in his "Address to the Deil," makes his witches and warlocks
"skim the muirs and dizzy crags" on "ragweed nags," "wi' wicked
speed." Witches notoriously ride swiftly and easily through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
air astride of a broomstick.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Hence this superstition may be said to
personify the light scudding clouds that pass rapidly across the sky,
and herald squally weather. Dr. Kuhn regards the broom as the implement
used by the Aryan demi-deities in sweeping the sky; for that
such was a portion of the duty devolving upon its riders may be
inferred from the still existing Hartz tradition that witches must
dance away all the snow upon the Blocksberg, on the first of May.</p>

<p>The hanging out of a broom when a man's wife is from home, to
intimate to the husband's unmarried friends that the usual matrimonial
restraint is temporarily suspended, and that bachelor fare and
bachelor habits will be the order of the day, for a time, is yet well
known in Lancashire. I am not aware how far it is practised or
understood in other parts of the country, neither have I been able to
find a satisfactory explanation of its origin. As the "Lancashire
witches" of the present day do "work their spells" upon their masculine
friends, though in a more pleasing form and agreeable manner than
their haggard and aged predecessors, it is not improbable that the
emblem of power may have accompanied the transmission of the
once dreaded appellation. Brooms, after being used in the performance
of divers mythical ceremonies, were hung up in houses, and
regarded, like pieces of the rowan or mountain ash-tree, as powerful
charms against the entrance of evil doers. Perhaps the "bachelor
husband" of by-gone times removed the broom to the outside of the
house with the view to destroy its power over the interior, as well as
to inform his roystering friends that the coast was clear, and that
there existed no impediment to unlimited jollification.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Dr. Kuhn
says in several parts of Westphalia, at Shrovetide, cows' horns are
decorated with white besoms with white handles. After the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
has been swept by them, they are hung, as a kind of talisman, over
or near the door of the cow-house. Have these white besoms any
relationship to those ornamental ones formerly much hawked in
England by German peasant girls, who likewise sung in the streets
the once popular song, "Buy a broom?"</p>

<p>Gaule says there were "eight classes of witches distinguished by
their operations: first, the diviner, gipsy or fortune telling witch;
second, the astrologian, star-gazing, planetary, prognosticating witch;
third, the chanting, canting, or calculating witch, who works by signs
or numbers; fourth, the venefick, or poisonous witch; fifth, the exorcist,
or conjuring witch; sixth, the gastromantick witch; seventh,
the magical, speculative, sciential, or arted witch; eighth, the necromancer."</p>

<p>Many of the practices of the modern gipsies seem to have
much in common with the older witchcraft. Fortune telling, divination,
&amp;c., appear to be their chief professional avocations at the present
time, notwithstanding the magisterial rigour to which such
imposture is subjected. Much learned discussion has been evoked
concerning the origin of this singular people. They appear to have
been first generally noticed in Europe about the beginning of the
fifteenth century. Some are said, however, to have arrived in Switzerland
somewhat earlier. They were styled gipsies because they
were believed to have wandered into Europe from Egypt. Their language,
and their superstitions, however, show their true origin to have
been Indian. Some writers contend that they left that country at the
time of the celebrated Timour's invasion, early in the fifteenth
century, and that their first resting place being in the country called
Zinganen, near the mouth of the Indus, probably explains why in
some countries they are called Zingari. Their next resting place
being Egypt most probably gave rise to their English appellation.
On the whole it seems not improbable that they spring from the
pariahs or lowest caste of Hindoos, now named Suders. The glass
globe or egg-shaped instrument, in which they profess to detect supernatural
revelations, appears to belong either to the sun image or
thunderbolt type of the Aryan mythology. Some of their conjuring,
juggling, and other feats of skill are suggestive of a similar paternity.
But the identity of the languages, in several essentials, notwithstanding
much corruption of the gipsy dialects, in consequence of their
admixture with those of other nations, is perhaps the most conclusive
proof of the Hindoo origin of these Zingari tribes.</p>

<p>The superstitious belief in the supernatural yet exists in Lancashire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
as well as in other counties of England, to a much greater extent than
highly educated people are apt to imagine. Gipsies ply their trade
with profit, and "wise women" and witches are by no means extinct.
The county of Somerset has recently furnished two remarkable
illustrations of this. The following appeared in the public press in
June, 1871:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lingering Superstition.</span>&mdash;At Wincanton, in Somersetshire, the
magistrates have had before them a charge arising out of the belief
in witchcraft which still prevails in that county. Ann Green accused
a labourer named William Higham of assaulting her. It appeared
that the defendant had long laboured under the delusion that he was
'overlooked' by the complainant, and in order to break the spell he
stabbed her twice. The sleeves of the garments which were worn by
the complainant were produced in court, saturated with blood. The
prisoner gravely informed the Bench that he did it to destroy Mrs.
Green's power over him, but that he had not yet found any relief.
The prisoner's mother said she had not been able to rest for a fortnight
past, as he was constantly saying that Mrs. Green was 'overlooking'
him, and that it would kill him. He was ordered to find
sureties or to be imprisoned for three weeks."</p>

<p>The following "went the round of the papers" in July, 1870:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A strange case of superstition has been brought before the magistrates
of Wincanton, in Somerset. A young man named Lamb,
fancying that a certain young woman, Mary Crees, had bewitched
him, rushed upon her, seized her by the throat, and pulling out his
penknife, attempted to wound her. In reply to the Bench he said,
'She overlooks I; that's as true as the hat's in my hand, and I
wanted to draw blood to stop her.' Two years ago he fell down in a
fit on seeing her."</p>

<p>The <i>Manchester Examiner and Times</i>, of June 24th, 1871, contained
the following "short leader":&mdash;</p>

<p>"The metropolitan police have been engaged in a laudable attempt
at putting down fortune-telling. They made a 'raid' the other evening
upon several professors of the cabalistic art, and in one house
found thirty or forty young women waiting to have their 'fortunes
told.' Perhaps the most important of the gentlemen arrested on the
occasion was a Mr. George Shepherd, who, however, appeared in
handbills printed for extensive circulation under the name of 'Professor
Cicero, of Rome, Palestine, Jerusalem, and the Holy Land.'
His rooms were fitted up with all the symbols of his craft, in every
branch of which he professed to be an adept. The fees varied from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sixpence to half-a-crown, according to the nature of the service
rendered, and a list was found in the place showing the number of
visitors&mdash;that is, customers&mdash;in so many consecutive weeks. These
figures, which have a certain interest as throwing light upon the
prevalence of popular credulity, ran as follow: 662, 250, 502, 380,
512, 513, 430, 89, 466. In Easter-week, including Good Friday,
there were only 217 callers, proving that the attractions of a holiday
outweigh even those of a visit to a modern temple of divination. But
the subject has a serious as well as a romantic side. The four 'Professors'
were all 'found guilty,' and committed to gaol for three
calendar months with hard labour. Probably no effectual stop will
be put to a very silly practice until the dupes are convicted as well as
the prime agents. It is perfectly well known that fortune-telling is
illegal, and a penalty should attach to all who figure in the transaction,
whether as seconds or principals."</p>

<p>The following appeared in a Manchester paper in 1865:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Superstition in Salford.</span>&mdash;At the Salford Town Hall, yesterday,
John Rhodes, apparently a respectable man, living at 226, Regent
Road, was charged, under the Vagrancy Act, with telling fortunes.
A girl, named Ellen Cooper, stated that she saw the prisoner at his
house, on Tuesday. After she had told him the date of her nativity,
the prisoner cast her horoscope, and told her what she might expect
would be her future fortune. For this she paid a shilling, which she
understood was his regular charge. During the time the girl was
there, several other females called on a similar errand, but did not
stay. From information given by the girl, Cooper, two detective
officers called at the prisoner's house on Thursday, where they found
him with a female standing beside him, whose future destiny he was
busy calculating, aided by an astrological work and a large slate. On
the latter were what was apparently intended as a representation of
the movements of the heavenly bodies. In the prisoner's house the
officers found a large number of books, including 'An Introduction to
Astrology,' by William Lilly; 'Raphael's Prophetic Alphabet';
'Occult Philosophy,' by Cornelius Agrippa (in manuscript); a work
on horary astrology, &amp;c. Besides these, six large volumes were seized,
which were filled with the names and the dates of the nativities of his
clients, neatly surrounded, in each case, with hieroglyphics. In addition
to these were manuscripts with forms of invocations to spirits to
do the will and bidding of the invoker; also love spells, and forms for
invoking evil destinies. The text of one of these was as follows:&mdash;'I
adjure and command you, ye strong, mighty, and powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
spirits, who are rulers of this day and hour, that ye obey me in this
my cause by placing my husband in his former situation under the
Trent Brewery Company, and I adjure you to banish all his enemies
out of his way and to make them to crouch in humiliation unto him
and acknowledge all the wrongs they have done unto him, and I bind
you by the name of Almighty God, and by our Lord Jesus Christ, and
by His precious blood, and on pain of everlasting damnation, that you
labour for him and complete and accomplish the whole of this my
will and desire, and not depart till the whole of this my will and
desire be fulfilled, and when you have accomplished the whole of these
my commands you shall be released from all these bonds and
demands, and this I guarantee through the blood of the Redeemer and
on pain of my future happiness. Let angels praise the Lord.
Amen.' Amongst the papers found there was sufficient evidence that,
amongst the prisoner's many hundreds of clients, there were those
who moved in a sphere of life not peculiar to the poorer classes.
Mr. Roberts defended the prisoner. Mr. Trafford said the practice
was so mischievous that he could not let the prisoner off without
some punishment; he must therefore send him to prison for seven
days."</p>

<p>From the following, which appeared in the <i>New Zealand Herald</i> in
1865, it appears the belief in witchcraft produces serious results
amongst the Maories:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From Kawhia we hear of wars and rumours of wars, instigated
probably by the desire of the semi-friendly natives there to be put on
rations and receive pay. Hone Wetere (John Wesley) late native
magistrate there, who was deposed from his office four years ago for
the abduction of a native woman, the wife of a sawyer named Wright,
has been adding to the interest of native proceedings at the present
time by the commission of a most brutal murder. It seems that this
late learned interpreter of the law had, with a zeal worthy of
Matthew Hopkins, condemned an old Maori woman of 'makutu,' or
witchcraft, and punished her by his own hands, cutting off her head
on the spot. This may appear to Auckland philo-Maories as something
startling and, perhaps, out of the way, but to us here it is no
extraordinary event. It is only a few years since two natives in our
district murdered a man and woman for the same reason, and cooked
a copper Maori over their grave. Much about the same time, at
Kawhia, a native and his wife pulled the heart out of their living child
under the impression that the poor infant was bewitched."</p>

<p>M. Paul B. Du Chaillu, in his "Journey to Ashango-land," relates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
many striking instances of the popular belief in witchcraft which
exists in Western Equatorial Africa. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As usual I heard a harrowing tale of witchcraft in the course of
the day. Few weeks pass away in these unhappy villages without
something of this kind happening. A poor fellow was singing a
mournful song, seated on the ground in the village street; and on
enquiring the cause of his grief I was told that the chief of the
village near his having died, and the magic doctor having declared
that five persons had bewitched him, the mother, sister, and brother
of the poor mourner had just been ruthlessly massacred by the excited
people, and his own house and plantation burnt and laid waste."
He describes at length the ceremonies attending the drinking of
the mboundou, or the ordeal by poison, which he witnessed at Mayolo.
If the poison kills the suspected person he is pronounced
guilty; but if, as in three instances he witnessed, the drinker
should, after severe spasms, vomit the deadly potion, he generally
recovers, and is declared innocent of the charge of witchcraft preferred
against him.</p>

<p>From these instances, and others which might be adduced, it is clear
that this superstition is a very ancient and a very universal one, in
some form, and therefore, not necessarily of exclusively Aryan origin;
but that it may result from similar conditions to which humanity is, or
has been, subjected in various parts of the globe. It is not impossible,
however, that the African instances referred to may have some very
remote connection with the Aryan superstitions of a similar character,
for M. Du Chaillu expressly declares his belief that the ancestors of
the present inhabitants of Western Equatorial Africa migrated from
the east. He says:&mdash;"The migration of the tribes, as I have
already observed, seems to have followed the same laws as migrations
among ourselves; I did not meet with a single tribe or clan who said
they came from the west; they all pointed to the east as the place
they came from."</p>

<p>Mr. T. T. Wilkinson gives the following very graphic description of
a Burnley witch, but recently deceased:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most nations of all ages have been accustomed to deck the graves
of their dead with appropriate flowers, much as we do at present.
The last words of the dying have, from the earliest times, been considered
of prophetic import; and, according to Theocritus, some one
of those present have endeavoured to receive into his mouth the last
breath of a dying parent or friend, '<i>as fancying the soul to pass out with
it and enter into their own bodies</i>.' Few would expect to find this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
singular custom still existing in Lancashire, and yet such is the fact.
Witchcraft can boast her votaries in this county even up to the
present date, and she numbers this practice amongst her rites and
ceremonies. Not many years ago, there resided in the neighbourhood
of Burnley, a female whose malevolent practices were supposed to
render themselves manifest by the injuries she inflicted on her neighbours'
cattle; and many a lucky-stone, many a stout horseshoe and
rusty sickle, may now be found behind the doors or hung from the
beams of the cow-houses and stables belonging to the farmers in that
locality, which date their suspension from the time when this good old
lady held the country side in awe. Not one of her neighbours ever
dared to offend her openly; and if she at any time preferred a request
it was granted at all hazards, regardless of inconvenience and
expense. If in some thoughtless moment any one spoke slightingly
either of her or her powers, a corresponding penalty was threatened
as soon as it reached her ears, and the loss of cattle, personal health,
or a general 'run of bad luck' soon led the offending party to think
seriously of making peace with his powerful tormentor. As time
wore on she herself sickened and died; but before she could 'shuffle
off this mortal coil,' she must needs <i>transfer her familiar spirit</i> to some
trusty successor. An intimate acquaintance from a neighbouring
township was consequently sent for in all haste, and on her arrival
was immediately closeted with her dying friend. What passed
between them has never fully transpired, but it is confidently affirmed
that at the close of the interview this associate <i>received the witch's last
breath into her mouth, and with it the familiar spirit</i>. The dreaded
woman thus ceased to exist, but her powers for good or evil were
transferred to her companion; and on passing along the road from
Burnley to Blackburn we can point out a farm-house at no great
distance, with whose thrifty matron no neighbouring farmer will yet
dare to quarrel."</p>

<p>This superstition respecting the reception of the spirit of the dying
by inhaling the last breath, must have existed from a very remote
antiquity. Psych&ecirc;, the Greek personification of the soul, as a word,
originally, simply meant breath. From the butterfly being the
emblem of Psych&ecirc;, the word became the name of the beautiful insect
likewise. The Zulus call a man's shadow his soul, which would seem
to be analogous to our churchyard ghost and the <i>umbra</i> of the
Romans. The Zulus hold that a dead body can cast no shadow,
because that appurtenance departed from it at the close of life.</p>

out the earliest known tavern or inn sign. The authors of the work referred to say:
"The bush certainly must be counted amongst the most ancient and popular of signs.
Traces of its use are not only found amongst Roman and other old world remains,
but during the middle ages we have evidence of its display." Kelly says "the broom
must originally have been supposed, like the sieve, to be used for some purpose or
other in the economy of the upper regions." Perhaps in the brewing of the "heavenly

character.</p></div>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">In</span> my youthful imagination, some forty odd years ago, "boggarts,"
ghosts, or spirits of one kind or another, in Lancashire, appeared, to
use Falstaff's phrase, to be "as plentiful as blackberries." "Boggart,"
by some writers is regarded as the Lancashire cognomen for "Puck"
or "Robin Goodfellow." Certainly there are, or were, many boggarts
whose mischievous propensities and rude practical jokings remind us
very forcibly of the eccentric and erratic goblin page to the fairy king,
so admirably delineated by Shakspere in his "Midsummer Night's
Dream":&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>There is some diversity and variety of colouring in the various
fairy types presented in different localities, but they have sufficient in
common to justify perfect faith in their near relationship, whether
they are styled Peris, as in Persia, Pixies, as in Devonshire, Ginns,
as in Arabia, Gnomes or Elves, amongst the Teutons, or "the Leprachaun"
or "Good people," of the sister Island. The finest modern
artistic realisation of the fairy kingdom is unquestionably to be found
in Shakspere's "Midsummer Night's Dream." How strangely, yet
how beautifully and consistently, has he there woven together his
ethereal conceptions with the grosser, as well as with the more
elevated aspect of our common humanity! How exquisite is the
poetry in which the visions of his imaginations are embodied! The
fairy-King Oberon thus describes his queen, Titania's, bower:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where oxslips and the nodding violet grows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sleeps Titania, some time of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the snake throws her enamelled skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again at the close of the play, Puck says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now it is the time of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the graves all gaping wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every one lets forth his sprite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the church-way paths to glide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we fairies that do run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the triple Hecat's team,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the presence of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following darkness like a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now are frolic.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Witches, fairies, ghosts, and boggarts seem to have become intimately
amalgamated in the <i>repertoire</i> of modern superstition. Doubtless
many of them have a common origin, and are but separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
developments, mythical or artistic, of the universal tendency of
primitive peoples to personify, or render more tangible to the ruder
sense, their conceptions of those forces of nature, the laws governing
which are, to them, hidden in the delusive gloom of ignorance.
"Feeorin" is a general term for all things of this character that create
fear in the otherwise intrepid heart of a "Lancashire lad." Mr.
Edwin Waugh, whose songs in the dialect are not more remarkable
for their quaint humour and homely pathos than for their idiomatic
truthfulness, aptly illustrates the mingling of the various supernatural
terrors to which I have referred, in his admirable ballad, "What ails
thee, my son Robin." The mother, alarmed at the lad's melancholy
mood, says, inquiringly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Neaw, arto fairy-stricken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or arto gradely ill?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hasto bin wi' th' witches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'th cloof, at deep o'th neet?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Robin replies&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tisn't lung o'th feeorin'<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It's yon blue een o' Mary's:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They taen my life away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Queen Mab appears to have been equally as mischievous an elf as
Puck. Shakspere says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">This is that very Mab<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That plats the manes of horses in the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bakes the <i>elf-locks</i> in foul sluttish hairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, once entangled, much misfortune bodes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mab, however, like Puck, seems to have had a large element of
humour in her composition, which is delineated with marvellous
grace and brilliancy in the celebrated speech of Mercutio, in "Romeo
and Juliet."</p>

<p>Boggarts, in some cases, appear to have been anything but
unwelcome guests. King James I., in his "D&aelig;monologie," describes
the spirit called a "brownie" as something that "appeared like a
rough man, and haunted divers houses without doing any evile, but
doing, as it were, necessarie turnes up and downe the house; yet some
were so blinded as to beleeve that their house was all the sonsier, as
they called it, that such spirits resorted there."</p>

<p>Mr. T. T. Wilkinson relates some good stories of Lancashire
goblins, who are believed to have determined the sites of Rochdale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Burnley, Samlesbury, and some other churches, by removing the
stones and scaffolding of the builders in the night time. There is
likewise a legend of this class in connection with the church at Winwich,
near Warrington, and another at Whaley-bridge, in Derbyshire.
Indeed, these goblin church builders are very common throughout
the land. In some cases the sprite assumes the form of the arch-fiend
himself. Referring to the famous boggart of Syke Lumb farm,
near Blackburn, Mr. Wilkinson says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When in a good humour, this noted goblin will milk the cows,
pull the hay, fodder the cattle, harness the horses, load the carts, and
stack the crops. When irritated by the utterance of some unguarded
expression or marked disrespect, either from the farmer or his
servants, the cream mugs are then smashed to atoms; no butter can
be obtained by churning; the horses and other cattle are turned
loose, or driven into the woods; two cows will sometimes be found
fastened in the same stall; no hay can be pulled from the mow; and
all the while the wicked imp sits grinning with delight upon one of
the cross beams in the barn. At other times the horses are unable
to draw the empty carts across the farm yard; if loaded they are
upset; whilst the cattle tremble with fear, without any visible cause.
Nor do the inmates of the house experience any better or gentler
usage. During the night the clothes are said to be violently torn from
off the beds of the offending parties, whilst, by invisible hands, they
themselves are dragged down the stone stairs by the legs, one step at
a time, after a more uncomfortable manner than we need describe."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkinson relates an anecdote of a near relation of his own,
who, although, "not more imbued with superstition than the
majority," firmly believed that he had once seen "a real dwarf or
fairy, without the use of any incantation. He had been amusing
himself one summer evening on the top of Mellor Moor, near Blackburn,
close to the remains of the Roman encampment, when his
attention was arrested by the appearance of a dwarf-like man, attired
in full hunting costume, with top boots and spurs, a green jacket, red
hairy cap, and a thick hunting whip in his hand. He ran briskly
along the moor for a considerable distance, when, leaping over a low
stone wall, he darted down a steep declivity, and was soon lost to
sight."</p>

<p>One of the best descriptions of a Lancashire boggart or bargaist<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
that I have met with, was written by the late Crofton Croker, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
published in Roby's "Traditions of Lancashire." I may just remark,
<i>en passant</i>, that the word "traditions," as applied to nearly the whole
of these stories, is a sad misnomer. The tales might, perhaps with
propriety, be termed <i>nouvelletes</i>, or little novels; but when put forth
as "traditions," in the true acceptation of the term, they are worse
than useless, for they are calculated equally to mislead both the
antiquary and the collector of "folk lore." Croker makes the scene
of his story what was once a retired and densely wooded dell, or deep
valley, in the township of Blackley, near Manchester, called to this
day, "Boggart Ho' Clough." This boggart sadly pestered a worthy
farmer, named George Cheetham, by "scaring his maids, worrying
his men, and frightening the poor children out of their senses, so that,
at last, not even a mouse durst shew himself indoors at the farm, as
he valued his whiskers, after the clock had struck twelve." This
same boggart, however, had some jolly genial qualities. His voice,
when he joined the household laughter, on merry tales being told and
practical jokes indulged in, around the hearth at Christmastide, is
described as "small and shrill," and as easily "heard above the rest,
<i>like a baby's penny trumpet</i>." He began to regard himself at last as a
"privileged inmate" and conducted himself in the most extraordinary
manner, snatching the children's bread and butter out of their hands,
and interfering with their porridge, milk, and other food. His
"invisible hand" knocked the furniture about in the most approved
modern style of goblin or spiritual manifestation. Yet, this mischievous
propensity did not prevent him from occasionally performing
some kindly acts, such as churning the cream and scouring the pans
and kettles! Truly, he was a "tricksty sprite." Croker refers to
one circumstance which he regards as "remarkable," and which will
remind modern readers very distinctly of a "spiritual" exhibition
which recently attracted much public attention. He says&mdash;"the
stairs ascended from the kitchen; a partition of boards covered the
ends of the steps, and formed a <i>closet</i> beneath the staircase. From
one of the boards of this partition a large round knot was accidently
displaced, and one day the youngest of the children, while playing
with the shoe-horn, stuck it into this knot-hole. Whether or not the
aperture had been formed by the boggart as a peep-hole to watch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
motions of the family, I cannot pretend to say. Some thought it was,
for it was called the boggart's peep-hole; but others said that they
had remembered it before the shrill laugh of the boggart was heard
in the house. However this may have been, it is certain that the
horn was ejected with surprising precision at the head of whoever put
it there; and either in mirth or in anger the horn was darted forth
with great velocity, and struck the poor child over the ear." To say
the least of it, it is rather remarkable that the mere substitution of the
words <i>structure</i> or <i>cabinet</i> for <i>closet</i>, and <i>trumpet</i> for <i>horn</i>, to say nothing
of the peculiar quality of the boggart's voice, should make the whole
so eloquently suggestive of the doings of a certain "Mr. Ferguson"
and his friends the Davenport Brothers, and other "spiritual manifestations"
recently so much in vogue. All this supernatural mountebanking
was, it appears, taken in good part by Mr. Cheetham's family,
and when the children or neighbours wished for a little excitement
they easily found it in "laking," that is, playing, with this eccentric
and pugnacious disembodied spirit.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>But Mr. Boggart eventually returned to his old avocations, and
midnight noises again disturbed the repose of the inmates of the
haunted house. Pewter pots and earthen dishes were dashed to the
floor, and yet, in the morning they were found perfectly uninjured,
and in their usual places. To such a pitch at last did matters reach,
that George Cheetham and his family were observed one day by
neighbour John Marshall sullenly following a cart that contained their
household goods and chattels. What transpired is best told in Mr.
Croker's own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Well, Georgy, and soa you're leaving th'owd house at last,' said
Marshall.</p>

<p>"'Heigh, Johnny, my lad, I'm in a manner forced to it, thou sees,'
replied the other, 'for that wearyfu' boggart torments us soa, we can
neither rest neet nor day for't. It seems loike to have a malice
agains t' young uns, an' it ommost kills my poor dame at thoughts
on't, and soa, thou sees, we're forced to flit like.'</p>

<p>"He had got thus far in his complaint when, behold, a shrill voice,
from a deep upright <i>churn</i>, the topmost utensil on the cart, called out,
'Ay, ay, neighbour, we're flitting, you see.'</p>

<p>"'Od rot thee,' exclaimed George, 'If I'd known thou'd been
flitting too, I wadn't ha' stirred a peg. Nay, nay, it's no use, Mally,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
he continued, turning to his wife, 'we may as weel turn back again
to th'owd house, as be tormented in another not so convenient.'"</p>

<p>In Florence of Worcester's Chronicle, under the date, 1138, a
singular story is related, which explains "how the devil, in the shape
of a black dwarf, was made a monk." From some of the details, it
appears to embody, in no slight degree, the popular superstition
regarding the mischievous Puck. On three distinct occasions the
cellars of a monastery at Prum, in the arch-diocese of Treves, had
been invaded, bungs wantonly withdrawn from casks, and good wine
spilled on the floor. The abbot, in despair, at length ordered the
bungholes to be "anointed round with chrism." On the following
morning "a wonderfully dwarfish black boy" was found "clinging by
the hands to one of the bungs." He was released, dressed in a monk's
habit, and made to associate with the other boys. He, however,
never uttered a word, either in public or private, or tasted food of any
kind. A neighbouring abbot pronounced him to be a devil lurking in
human form; and, the chronicle informs us, "while they were in the
act of stripping off his monastic dress, he vanished from their hands
like smoke."</p>

<p>This sort of superstition was devotedly respected by even such men
as Martin Luther. He tells us of a demon who officiated as <i>famulus</i>
in a monastery. He was a good hand at an earthly bargain too, and
insisted on having full measure for his money, when employed to fetch
beer for the monks.</p>

<p>I remember in my youth hearing a story of a headless boggart that
haunted Preston streets and neighbouring lanes. Its presence was
often accompanied by the rattling of chains. I forget now what was
its special mission. It frequently changed its form, however, but
whether it appeared as a woman or a black dog, it was always headless.
The story went that this boggart or ghost was at length "laid"
by some magical or religious ceremony in Walton Church yard. I
have often thought that the story told by Weaver, a Preston antiquary,
in his "Funerall Monuments," printed in 1631, and which I
have transcribed at page 149 of the "History of Preston and its
Environs," may have had some remote connection with this tradition.
He relates how Michael Kelly, the celebrated Dr. Dee's companion,
together with one Paul Wareing, "invocated some of the infernal
regiment, to know certain passages in the life, as also what might bee
knowne by the devils foresight, of the manner and the time of the
death of a noble young gentleman then in his wardship." He
further relates how, on the following evening they dug up in Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
(Walton) Church yard, the corpse of a man recently buried, when,
"by their incantations, they made him (or rather some evil spirit
through his organs) to speake, who delivered strange predictions concerning
the said gentleman." From the whole of this narration, it is
evident that Weaver honestly believed some special sorcery or <i>diablerie</i>
had been perpetrated in the localities referred to.</p>

<p>This belief that the devil made use of other organs than his own, in
giving expression to his thoughts or opinions was shared in by the
learned. Melanchthon tells us of an Italian girl who was "possessed"
with a devil, and who, although she knew no Latin, quoted Virgil
fluently (at least Satan did through her organ of speech), when questioned
by a Bolognese professor. This anecdote is rather unpleasantly
suggestive of certain recent clairvoyant exhibitions.</p>

<p>Amongst other youthful terrors to which I remember being subjected,
one had reference to a mythic monster styled "raw head and
bloody bones." This boggart appeared to partake of the cannibal
nature of some of the giants and ogres in our nursery tales, one of which,
on the approach of the redoubtable "Jack, the Giant-killer," called out
to his wife, "I smell fresh meat!" or according to the popular rhyme&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 27em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fee, fo, fam, I smell the blood of an Englishman!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be he alive or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to salt and bread!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">The said "raw head and bloody bones," I was seriously informed,
preferred to breakfast on the bodies of naughty children, nicely
roasted! I can likewise remember well being told that boggarts
especially loved to haunt and otherwise annoy those who refused to
<i>believe</i> in their existence. After experience, I need scarcely say, has
demonstrated the contrary to be much nearer the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Waugh, in his "Grave of Grislehurst Boggart," gives
a vivid picture of this species of superstition as it still exists in Lancashire.
The story is admirably told in a conversation between the
author, an old weaver and his dame, and is replete with characteristic
traits. It seems this boggart, although it was supposed to be "laid"
in the most orthodox manner, still troubled the neighbourhood. The
old dame declares&mdash;"It's a good while sin it were laid; an' there
were a cock buried wi' it, we a stoop (a stake) driven through it. It 're
nooan settled with a little, aw'll uphowd yo."</p>

<p>"'And do you really think,' said the author, 'that this place has
been haunted by a boggart?'</p>

<p>"'Has bin&mdash;be far!' replied the dame. 'It is neaw! Yodd'n
soon find it eawt, too, iv yo live't oppo th' spot. It's very mich iv it
wouldn't may yor yure fair ston of an end, othur with one marlock or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
another. There's noan so mony folk oppo this country side at likes
to go deawn yon lone at after delit (daylight), aw con tell yo.'</p>

<p>"'But it's laid and buried,' replied the author, 'it surely doesn't
trouble you much now.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, well,' said the old woman, 'iv it doesn't, it doesn't; so there
needs no moor. Aw know some folk winnut believe sich things;
there is some at'll believe naught at o' iv it isn't fair druven into
um, wilto, shalto; but this is a different case, mind yo. Eh, never
name it; thoose at has it to dhyel wi knows what it is; but thoose at
knows naught abeawt sich like&mdash;whau, it's like summat an' nawt
talkin' to 'um abeawt it; so we'n e'en lap it up where it is.'"</p>

<p>This boggart, from its doings, appears to have been an exact
counterpart of George Cheetham's plague. On Mr. Waugh inquiring
if the weaver never thought of digging into the grave in order to
satisfy his curiosity on the matter, the old lady broke in with&mdash;"Naw;
he'll delve noan theer, nut iv aw know it.... Nor no
mon elze dar lay a finger oppo that greawnd. Joseph Fenton's a
meeterly bowd chap, an' he's ruvven everything up abeawt this
country side, welly, but he dar not touch Gerzlehus' Boggart for his
skin! An' I howd his wit good, too, mind yo!"</p>

<p>The Grislehurst dame seems to have placed some emphasis on the
fact, when their ghost or boggart was "laid," that "there was a cock
buried wi' it." This ceremony resulted, doubtless, from a lingering
remnant of the ancient and almost universal superstition that the
soul departeth from the body in the form of a bird. This Dr. Kuhn
regards as intimately connected with the Aryan belief respecting birds
being soul-bringers. I am not aware, however, whether the barn-door
fowl is included amongst the numerous lightning birds, which
Kelly describes as having "nestled in the fire-bearing tree," of which
the clouds formed the foliage, and the sun, moon, and stars the fruit.</p>

<p>In Willsford's "Nature's Secrets" (1658), is, however, the following
passage, which shows the connection of the common fowl with stormy
weather:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The vigilant cock, the bird of Mars, the good housewife's clock
and the Switzer's alarum, if he crows in the day-time very much, or
at sun-setting, or when he is at roost at unusual hours, as at nine or
ten, expect some change of weather, and that suddenly, and that from
fair to foul, or the contrary; but when the hen crows, good men
<i>expect a storm within doors and without</i>. If the hen or chickens in the
morning come late from their roosts (as if they were constrained by
hunger), it presages much rainy weather."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The Romans used fowls in divination. Mohammed, too, is said to
have included amongst his domestic pets a white cock, which he
regarded as his friend, and considered that it protected him from the
machinations of witchcraft, of genii and devils, and of the evil eye.</p>

<p>Mr. T. T. Wilkinson relates a curious anecdote, which he had, a
few years ago, from a respectable gentleman, in the neighbourhood of
Burnley, about "killing a witch." His informant was one of the
farmers engaged in the mystical ceremony, the object of which was
the destruction of a wizard who had wrought sad havoc amongst his
neighbours' cattle. He says:&mdash;"They met at the house of one of
their number, whose cattle were then supposed to be under the
influence of the wizard; and, having procured a live cock chicken,
they stuck him full of pins and burnt him alive, whilst repeating some
magical incantation.... The wind suddenly rose to a tempest,
and threatened the destruction of the house. Dreadful moanings, as
of some one in intense agony, were heard from without, whilst a sense
of horror seized upon all within. At the moment when the storm
was at the wildest, the wizard knocked at the door, and, in piteous
tones, desired admittance. They had previously been warned, by the
'wise man' they had consulted, that such would be the case, and had
been charged not to yield to their feelings of humanity by allowing
him to enter." The violent death of the cock, it appears, was necessary
<i>to raise the storm</i>. The sequel of the story informs us that
exposure to its violence killed the presumed wizard in the course of
a week.</p>

<p>There is a superstition in Cornwall that the crowing of a cock at
midnight indicates that the angel of death is passing over the house.
Mr. Hunt relates the following anecdote, from which it appears that
chanticleer is largely credited in that district with supernatural
attributes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A farmer in Towednack having been robbed of some property of
no great value, was resolved, nevertheless, to employ a test which he
had heard the 'old people' resorted to for the purpose of catching a
thief. He invited all his neighbours into his cottage, and when they
were assembled, he placed a cock under the 'brandice' (an iron
vessel formerly much employed by the peasantry in baking, when this
process was carried out on the hearth, the fuel being furze and ferns).
Every one was directed to touch the brandice with his, or her third
finger, and say, 'In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
speak.' Every one did as they were directed, and no sound came
from beneath the brandice. The last person was a woman, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
occasionally laboured for the farmer in his fields. She hung back,
hoping to pass unobserved amidst the crowd. But her very anxiety
made her a suspected person. She was forced forward, and most
unwillingly she touched the brandice, when, before she could utter
the words prescribed, the cock crew. The woman fell faint on the
floor, and, when she recovered, she confessed herself to be the thief,
restored the stolen property, and became, it is said, 'a changed
character from that day.'"</p>

<p>Shakspere appears to have been fully aware of the prevalence of a
superstition which attributed to ghosts and wandering spirits a wholesome
dread of the sonorous tones of chanticleer's early morning song.
In the first scene in Hamlet, on the departure of the ghost, Bernardo
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>And again, Puck, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, referring to the
morning star or early dawn, which awakeneth chanticleer, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;"><div class="stanza">

<p>The cock was one of the attendants or emblems of &AElig;sculapius or
Ascl&ecirc;pius, the god of medicine of the Greek mythology, and this
fowl was commonly sacrificed to him. In addition to his knowledge
in the art of healing disease, he possessed the power of raising
the dead to life. He was believed to be the son of Apollo.
According to Plato, the last words of Socrates were, "Criton, we owe
a cock to Ascl&ecirc;pius." This bird, as well as the serpent, was one of
his sacred emblems.</p>

<p>The Roman god Janus is regarded by many to be in some respects
a Latin form of the Greek Ascl&ecirc;pius. He opens the year and the
daily morning, and is the porter of heaven. One of his peculiar
emblems was a cock, by the means of whose matutinal song he was
supposed to announce the approach of the dawn.</p>

<p>The crowing of a cock of the colour of gold is to be the signal of
the dawn of <i>Ragnarock</i>, "the great day of arousing," according to
Scandinavian mythology. A black cock is likewise said to crow in
the <i>Niflheim</i>, or "land of gloom."</p>

<p>J. Bossewell, in "Workes of Armourie" (1597), says:&mdash;"The
lyon dreadeth the white cocke, because he breedeth a precious stone
called allectricium, like to the stone that bright Calcedonius, and
for that the cocke beareth such a stone, the lyon specially abhorreth
him." The stone referred to was said to be similar to a dark crystal,
and about the size of a bean.</p>

<p>A most astounding story affirming the supernatural attributes of
chanticleer is related in Pinkerton's "General Collection of Voyages
and Travels." In the "Voyage to Congo," a Capuchin "missioner,"
named Father Morolla, relates the following remarkable incident with
the utmost gravity and evidently with perfect faith in the veracity of
the story:&mdash;On the capture of a certain town by the army of Sogno,
a large cock was found with an iron ring attached to one of its legs.
The unfortunate rooster was speedily placed in the pot and boiled in
the most orthodox fashion. When, however, his captors were about
to commence their improvised feast, to their astonishment the cooked
"pieces of the cock, though sodden and near dissolved, began to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
about, and unite into the form they were in before, and being so
united, the restored cock immediately raised himself up, and jumped
out of the platter upon the ground, where he walked about as well as
when he was first taken. Afterwards he leaped upon an adjoining
wall, where he became new-feathered all of a sudden, and then took
his flight to a tree hard by, where, fixing himself, he, after three
claps of his wings, made a most hideous noise, and then disappeared.
Every one may imagine what a terrible fright the spectators were in
at this sight, who, leaping with a thousand Ave-Marias in their
mouths from the place where this had happened, were contented to
observe most of the particulars at a distance."</p>

<p>The fabulous animal, the cockatrice, was believed to result from a
"venomous egg" laid by an aged cock, and hatched by a toad. The
monster had the head and breast of the dunghill champion, and
"thence downwards the body of a serpent." Toads are frequently
referred to by old writers in connection with witches and witchcraft.</p>

<p>In a MS. "Medycine Boke," belonging to Dr. Sampson Jones, of
Bettws, Monmouthshire (1650-90), is the following strange recipe,
entitled, "Cock water for a consumption and cough of the lungs":&mdash;"Take
a running cock and pull (pluck) him alive, then kill him and
cutt him in pieces and take out his intrals and wipe him cleane, breake
the bones, then put him into an ordinary still with a pottle of sack
and a pottle of red cow's milk," etc., etc.</p>

<p>The mythical character and medical qualities of red cow's milk
have been referred to in the previous chapter.</p>

<p>Lightning birds were supposed to come "down to earth either as
incorporations of the lightning, or bringing with them a branch
charged with latent or invisible fire." The eagle or the falcon was
the form which Agni, the fire-god, assumed on such occasions. The
fire-birds were very numerous, and included the woodpecker, the robin,
the wren, the owl, the cuckoo, the stork, the swallow, and the hoopoe.
Kelly quotes the Herefordshire rhyme as evidence that the ancient
superstition respecting the wren is still alive in England, as well as
in France, Scotland, Wales, and the Isle of Man. The peasants
there say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Robin Redbreast and Jenny Wren<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are God Almighty's cock and hen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">In Lancashire, however, the rhyme is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A robin and a wren<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are God's cock and hen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>And it is generally followed by the intimation that</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A spink and a sparrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the devil's bow and arrow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">To kill or rob the nests of these sacred birds was supposed to hazard
the destruction of the culprit's residence by lightning. A Cornish
rhyme says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those who kill a robin or a wran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never prosper, boy or man.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the "laying" of the redoubted Grislehurst boggart, it is not improbable,
as ghosts are not easily coffined in a corporeal sense, that
some superannuated old rooster, who had disturbed the bodily rest,
and scared the wits of the neighbouring rustics by some untoward
cock-a-doodle-doing, furnished all that was really "laid" in the mysterious
grave referred to. An impression may have been entertained
that the troublesome elf who had turned the household topsy-turvy
had made the said rooster's corpus his temporary earthly tabernacle.
Perhaps the "wise men" of the hamlet vainly imagined that nought
was required but the driving of a "stoop" through the feathered
repository to utterly "squelch" its ghostly occupant.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, a paragraph from the <i>Carnatic Telegraph</i>
has "gone the round of the press," relating to the "casting out of
devils," as at present practised in India. From this, it appears that
the cock is, with the Hindoos as with the Lancashire peasant, a most
potent instrument in the subjugation of troublesome spirits. The
Hindoo exorcist tied his patient's hair in a knot, and then with a
nail attached it to a tree. Muttering some "incantatory" stanzas,
he seized a live cock, and, holding it over the poor girl's head with
one hand, he, with the other, cut its throat. The blood-stained knot
of hair was left attached to the tree, which was supposed to detain
the demon. It is firmly believed that one "or a legion thus exorcised
will haunt that tree till he or they shall choose to take possession of
some other unfortunate."</p>

<p>In a work published in 1869, entitled "Count Teleki; a Story of
Modern Jewish Life and Customs, by Eca," the author describes a
ceremony called the "Keparoth or atoning sacrifice," in which the
common barn-door fowl plays an important part. The penitent
"whirled a cock around his head, saying, 'This is my atonement, this
is my ransom. This cock goeth to death, but may I be gathered and
enter into a long and happy life and into peace.' This he repeated
three times.... The sacrifice consists of a cock for the male,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and a hen for a female. A white fowl is preferred to any other, in
allusion to the words of the prophet, 'Though your sins be as scarlet
they shall become white as snow.' A pregnant woman takes three,
two hens and one cock, one hen for herself and the other two for the
unborn infant&mdash;the hen lest it should be a girl, and the cock lest it
should be a boy." The fowls are immediately afterwards handed
over to the Jewish butcher to be killed.</p>

<p>A yet very prevalent superstition asserts that a person at the point
of death finds serious difficulty in "shuffling off this mortal coil"
should there happen to be any game cock feathers in the bed on
which he lies. Pigeons' feathers are likewise said to prolong the
agonies of death.</p>

<p>In France, a black cock is the chief instrument employed to raise
the devil, and extract from the fiend sums of money. The incantation
must be performed at a locality where four roads meet or two
cross each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkinson, referring to the Hothersall Hall boggart, says it
"is understood to have been '<i>laid</i>' under the roots of a large laurel
tree, at the end of the house, and will not be able to molest the
family so long as that tree exists. It is a common opinion in that
part of the country that the roots have to be moistened with milk on
certain occasions, in order to prolong its existence, and also to preserve
the power of the spell under which the goblin is laid."</p>

<p>The laurel here appears to be invested with the mythical properties of
the ash and the rowan trees, which were supposed to possess irresistible
power over "witches, fairies, and other imps of darkness." The
author of "Choice Notes" quotes an Aberdeenshire couplet, which
asserts that</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rowan, ash, and red thread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep the devils frae their speed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">and further adds:&mdash;"It is a common practice with the housewives in
the same district to tie a piece of red worsted thread round their
cows' tails previous to turning them out to grass for the first time in
the spring. It secures their cattle, they say, from an evil eye, from
being elfshot by fairies, etc." The red thread is here, like the berries
of the rowan, the mutch of the woodpecker, the red breast of the
robin, etc., in the Aryan myths, typical of the lightning.</p>

<p>In many nooks and corners of Lancashire, and some other parts
of England, other stories may be found, many of which point to the
Puck or Robin Goodfellow of the fairy mythology as their most
probable prototype.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Roby says:&mdash;"The English Puck (the Lancashire Boggart), the
Scotch Bogie, the French Goblin, the Gobelinus of the Middle Ages,
and the German Kobold, are probably only varied names for the
Grecian Khobalus,&mdash;whose sole delight consists in perplexing the
human race, and evoking those harmless terrors that constantly hover
round the minds of the timid. So, also, the German Spuck, and the
Danish Spogel, correspond to the northern Spog; whilst the German
Hudkin, and the Icelandic Puki, exactly answer to the character of
the English Robin Goodfellow."</p>

<p>These English domestic sprites or elves that seem to claim a species
of kinship to those they alternately torment and render substantial
aid, clearly find their counterparts in the ghost and fairy lore of
other nations. Kelly says, "Many similar tales are told of the
German Zwergs, or dwarfs, who are the same race of little people as
the elves and fairies that live in the hearts of green hills and mounds
in Great Britain and Ireland. Often does it happen that a whole
colony of these Zwergs effects an exodus from a German district,
because the people have given them some offence, or 'have become
too knowing for them;' and on these occasions there is always a river
to be crossed." This was ever a difficulty, but not an unconquerable
one, with the German elves. In England and Scotland a certain
class of goblin or ghost found a running stream an impassable
barrier. Poor Tam O'Shanter's mare Meg demonstrated the truth
of this by the sacrifice of her caudal appendage. Grimm says that
many facts tend to show a near relationship between elves of this
class and the souls of men. The ordinary ghosts of the present day,
whether voluntary visitors or obedient servants of "spirit mediums,"
are supposed to be the souls of the departed. Kelly says, on the
authority of Kuhn and Schwartz, "Some of the many names by
which the Zwergs are known in North Germany mean the 'ancients'
or the 'ancestors,' and mark the analogy between the beings so
designated and the Hindoo Pitris or Fathers; whilst other
names&mdash;Holden (<i>i.e.</i>, good, kind) in Germany; good people, good neighbours,
in Ireland and Scotland&mdash;connect the same elves with the Manes of
the Romans." The Pitris of the Hindoos seem to furnish the germ
of "good fairies," the fairy godmother, the Persian Peris, the Arabic
Ginns, the chief of the followers of Oberon and Titania, and of the
kindlier phase in the character of Puck, Robin Goodfellow, or the
Lancashire bogie, or domestic boggart, but the larking propensity of
this sprite may possibly have resulted from a more modern addition
to the spirit lore of the Northern Aryan people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Jno. Aubrey, Fellow of the Royal Society, in his "Miscellanies,"
published in 1696, gives what he styles "a Collection of Hermetic
Philosophy," which exhibits an astonishing amount of superstition,
even amongst the presumedly learned men of the age. Amongst
other things he informs his readers, on the authority of a letter from
a "learned friend," in Scotland, that a certain Lord Duffin was
suddenly transported, by fairies, from his residence in Morayshire,
and that he was "found the next day in Paris, in the French king's
cellar, with a silver cup in his hand!" Such a feat was worthy of
the sprite who could put a "girdle round the earth in forty minutes."
Truly, as Ben Johnson's Puck says, he could "travel swifter than
the wind with a load of humanity on his back."</p>

<p>Our ordinary stories of churchyard ghosts, and other apparitions
and "spiritual manifestations," have much more in common with
the "folk-lore" of classical antiquity than is generally known. There
is a story told by Pliny the younger, which so much resembles many
that we have heard in youth, that nothing is required but a change
of name, place, and date, to thoroughly domesticate it amongst us.
It is related as follows, in Melmoth's translation of Pliny's letters:</p>

<p>"There was at Athens a large and spacious house which lay under
the disrepute of being haunted. In the dead of the night a noise
resembling the clashing of iron was frequently heard, which, if you
listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains; at first
it seemed at a distance, but approached nearer by degrees; immediately
afterwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man,
extremely meagre and ghastly, with a long beard and dishevelled
hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands.... By this
means the house was at last deserted, being judged by everybody to
be absolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned
to the ghost. However, in hopes that some tenant might be found
who was ignorant of this great calamity which attended it, a bill
was put up giving notice that it was either to be let or sold. It
happened that the philosopher Athenodorus came to Athens at this
time, and, reading the bill, inquired the price. The extraordinary
cheapness raised his suspicion; nevertheless, when he heard the
whole story, he was so far from being discouraged that he was more
strongly inclined to hire it, and, in short, actually did so. When it
drew towards evening, he ordered a couch to be prepared for him in
the fore part of the house, and, after calling for a light, together
with his pen and tablets, he directed all his people to retire. But
that his mind might not, for want of employment, be open to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
vain terrors of imaginary noises and spirits, he applied himself to
writing with the utmost attention. The first part of the night passed
with usual silence, when at length the chains began to rattle; however
he neither lifted up his eyes nor laid down his pen, but diverted
his observation by pursuing his studies with greater earnestness.
The noise increased, and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door,
and at last in the chamber. He looked up, and saw the ghost exactly
in the manner it had been described to him; it stood before him,
beckoning with his finger. Athenodorus made a sign with his hand
that it should wait a little, and then threw his eyes again upon his
papers; but, the ghost still rattling his chains in his ears, he looked
up, and saw him beckoning as before. Upon this he immediately
arose, and, with the light in his hand, followed it. The ghost slowly
stalked along, as if encumbered with his chains, and turning into the
area of the house, suddenly vanished. Athenodorus, being thus
deserted, made a mark, with some grass and leaves, where the spirit
left him. The next day he gave information to the magistrates, and
advised them to order that spot to be dug up. This was accordingly
done, and the skeleton of a man in chains was there found; for the
body having lain for a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied
and mouldered away from the fetters. The bones, being collected
together, were publicly buried, and thus, after the ghost was appeased
by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more."</p>

<p>I was forcibly struck with the peculiarly Eastern character of a
traditionary observance related to me during my investigation of the
remains found in the ancient British tumulus at Over Darwen, in
Lancashire, in November, 1864. I was informed that the country
people spoke of the mound as a locality haunted by "boggarts," and
that children were in the habit of taking off their clogs or shoes,
under the influence of some such superstitious feeling, when walking
past it in the night time.</p>

<p>Keppel, in his "Visit to the Indian Archipelago," refers to a
somewhat similar superstition in Northern Australia. The natives
will not willingly approach graves at night alone; "but when they
are obliged to pass them, they carry a fire stick to keep off the spirit
of darkness."</p>

<p>It is perhaps scarcely necessary that I should refer to the fact that
recent naturalists have satisfactorily demonstrated that the green
circles termed "fairy rings," have nothing "supernatural" in their
character, being simply a result of the growth of a species of fungus.
Not long ago, "the learned" contended that they resulted from some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
obscure kind of electric action. Sir Walter Scott, who held this
opinion, sneeringly refers to them as "electrical rings, which vulgar
credulity supposes to be traces of fairy revels." Thousands of English
peasants, yes, and many presumedly much wiser people, nevertheless,
yet firmly adhere to the ancient faith. Singularly enough,
Shakspere seems almost to have intuitively guessed at their true origin.
When Prospero, for the last time invokes the aid of the supernatural,
he exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<h3><small>FERN-SEED AND ST. JOHN'S-WORT SUPERSTITIONS.</small></h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">I had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No medicine, sir, to go invisible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fern-seed in my pocket.<br /></span>
</div><div class="rgt"><i>Ben Jonson.</i></div></div>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">Most</span> peoples have, in some form or other, preserved the traditionary
superstition that fern-seed was miraculously endowed with the power
of rendering its possessor invisible. The great hero of our boyish
days, the redoubtable "Jack, the Giant-killer," had his "coat of
darkness," which conferred upon its proprietor this marvellous peculiarity.
In the classical mythology, the helmet given to Hades or
Pluto likewise possessed the power of rendering the wearer invisible.
In the Teutonic, the "invisible cap" of the Nibelungenlied possessed
a similar property.</p>

<p>Shakspere makes Gadshill allude to it in a metaphorical sense.
He is anxious to impress upon the mind of the chamberlain of the
hostelry, near the scene of Falstaff's famous robbing exploit, that
although he was engaged in an illegal enterprise, he was in league
with companions of such high social status that the officers of the
law would be unable to perceive their criminality if detected. He
says:&mdash;"We steal as in a castle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of
fern-seed, we walk invisible." Beaumont and Fletcher, in the "Fair
Maid of the Inn," have the following reference to this superstition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Had you not Gyges' ring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the herb that gives invisibility?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a curious tract, published in the reign of Elizabeth, entitled
"Plaine Percevall, the Peacemaker," the following passage occurs:&mdash;"I
thinke the mad slave hath tasted on a fernstalke, that he walkes so
invisible."</p>

<p>Fairies, of course, possessed the power of rendering themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
visible, or otherwise, at pleasure. Oberon, in A Midsummer Night's
Dream, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But who comes here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am invisible, and I will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Overhear their conference.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Spirits of any class, of course, possessed this power, and its complement,
that of being visible, at pleasure. Prospero, in the Tempest,
says to Ariel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go make thyself like to a nymph o' the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be subject to no sight but mine; invisible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every eyeball else.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All ferns, according to German authorities, and especially the
"seed" thereof, possessed the quality usually described as "luck
bringing." According to Panzer, the devil was compelled to fulfil
the wish of any person in possession of the seed of this plant; and
Meier tells us that in Swabia the peasants believe that the possession
of this seed, obtained from his Satanic majesty between the hours
of eleven and twelve o'clock on Christmas night, will enable one
man to do the work of twenty or thirty others not so favoured.
Browne, in his "Britannia's Pastorals," speaks of "the wonderous one
night seeding ferne;" and Richard Bivot, in his "Pand&aelig;monium,"
published in 1648, quaintly informs us that "much discourse hath
been about gathering of fern seed (which is looked upon as a magical
herb) on the night of Midsummer-eve; and I remember I was told
of one who went to gather it, and the spirits whisk't by his ears like
bullets, and sometimes struck his hat and other parts of his body;
in fine, although he apprehended he had gotten a quantity of it, and
secured it in papers, and a box besides, when he came home he found
all empty."</p>

<p>Kelly says,&mdash;"The summer solstice is a favourite season for gathering
plants of the lightning tribe, and particularly the springwort and
fern. It is believed in the Oberpfalz that the springwort, or St.
John's-wort (johanniswurzel) as some call it, can only be found
among the fern on St. John's night. It is said to be of a yellow
colour, and to shine in the night like a candle; which is just what
is said of the mandrake in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript of the tenth
or eleventh century. Moreover, it never stands still, but hops about
continually, to avoid the grasp of men. Here, then, in the luminosity
and power of nimble movement attributed to the springwort,
we have another remarkable tradition signifying the transformation
of the lightning into the plant."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The following translation from a German poem, beautifully illustrates
the Teutonic form of this superstition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The young maid stole through the cottage door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blushed as she sought the plant of power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou silver glow-worm, O lend me thy light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must gather the mystic St. John's-wort to-night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonderful herb whose leaf will decide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the coming year shall make me a bride!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the glow-worm came<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his silvery flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sparkled and shone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the night of St. John.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon as the young maid her love-knot tied<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With noiseless tread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To her chamber she sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the spectral moon her white beams shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bloom here, bloom here, thou plant of power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deck the young bride in her bridal hour!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it drooped its head, that plant of power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died the mute death of a voiceless flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a withered leaf on the ground it lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More meet for a burial than a bridal day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when a year was passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All pale on her bier the young maid lay!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the glow-worm came<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With its silvery flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sparkled and shone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the night of St. John;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they closed the cold grave o'er the maid's cold clay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vernaleken says the Slavocks believe that any person approaching
too near to the fern, at the time of its "efflorescence," will be overcome
by drowsiness, and that beings of a supernatural character will
successfully resist any attempt to lay hands on the plant. Bivot has
a statement to a somewhat similar effect.</p>

<p>A remarkable story respecting the magical quality of fern seed is
related by Jacob Grimm, in his "Deutsche Mythologie." It is said
to be a popular one with the people of Westphalia. A man, in search
of a foal, passed through a meadow on Midsummer's Eve, when some
ripening fern seed fell into his shoes. He did not return home until
the following morning, when he was astonished to find that his wife
and children appeared utterly unconscious of his presence. When
he called out to them, "I have not found the foal," the greatest
alarm and confusion followed, for the members of his household
could hear his voice but failed to detect his person. Fancying he
was hiding in jest, his wife called out his name. He answered,
"Here I am right before you. Why do you call me?" This but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
increased their terror. The man perceiving that he was, to them
invisible, thought it not improbable that something in his shoes,
which felt like sand, might really prove to be fern seed. He accordingly
pulled them off, and as he scattered the grains on the floor
resumed his visibility to the eyes of his astounded family.</p>

<p>In an ancient "Calendar of the Romish Church," the 23rd June,
the vigil of the nativity of John the Baptist, is stated to be prolific
in supernatural phenomena. Amongst others we are informed that
"waters are swum in during the night, and are brought in vessels
that hang for the purposes of divination;" that "fern is in great
estimation with the vulgar, on account of its seed." We are further
informed that "herbs of different kinds are sought with many ceremonies."
Monsieur Bergerac, in his "Satyrical Characters," translated
"out of the French, by a Person of Honour," in 1658, makes
a magician of the period enumerate amongst his many powers
and duties the "wakening of the country fellow on St. John's eve
to gather his hearb, fasting and in silence." Brand says that
"a respectable countryman, at Heston, in Middlesex," had stated to
him that he had often been "present at the ceremony of catching
the fern seed at midnight on the eve of St. John the Baptist. The
attempt, he said, was often unsuccessful, for the seed was to fall into
the plate of its own accord, and that, too, without shaking the plant."</p>

<p>Referring to our Lancashire superstitions Mr. T. T. Wilkinson
says:&mdash;"Fern seed is still said to be gathered on the Holy Bible,
and is believed to be able to render those invisible who will dare to
take it; and herbs for the use of man and beasts are still collected
when their proper planets are ruling in the heavens."</p>

<p>Ceremonies on St. John's Eve are likewise regarded as very potent
in matters matrimonial. Bivot describes a party of fair ladies who
say,&mdash;"We have been told divers times that if we fasted on Midsummer
Eve, and then at twelve o'clock at night laid a cloth on the
table, with bread and cheese, and a cup of the best beer, setting
ourselves down as if we were going to eat, and leaving the door of
the room open, we should see the persons whom we should afterwards
marry, come into the room and drink to us."</p>

<p>The belief in the power of fern seed in the domain over which
Cupid is said to preside, still lingers in various parts of Lancashire.
The best story of this class that I have met with, is related by Samuel
Bamford, in his "Passages in the Life of a Radical." One Bangle,
a Lancashire youth, "of ardent temperament but bashful withal,"
had become enamoured of the daughter of a neighbouring farmer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"His modest approaches had not been noticed by the adored one;
and, as she had danced with another youth at Bury fair, he imagined
she was irrecoverably lost to him, and the persuasion had driven him
melancholy. Doctors had been applied to, but he was no better;
philters and charms had been tried to bring down the cold-hearted
maid, but all in vain.... At length sorcerers and fortune-tellers
were thought of, and 'Limping Billy,' a noted seer, residing
at Radcliffe Bridge, having been consulted, said the lad had no chance
of gaining power over the damsel, unless he could take St. John's
fern seed; and if he could but secure three grains of that, he might
bring to him whatever he wished, that walked, flew, or swam."</p>

<p>Two friends, Plant, a country botanist, and Chirrup, a bird catcher,
agreed to accompany Bangle in his expedition in search of the potent
fern seed. Plant said he knew where the finest specimens of the
herb grew, and led the way to the "Boggart Ho' Clough," referred to
in the preceding chapter. The three worthies assembled on the Eve
of St. John, at midnight, in this then thickly wooded glen. As a
part of the necessary cabalistic implements, Plant brought an earthen
dish, "brown and roof" [rough], Chirrup a pewter platter, which he
regarded as "breet enough" for their purpose; Bangle's contribution,
which he described as "teed wi' web an' woof," and "deep enough,"
was "a musty dun skull, with the cap sawn off above the eyes, and
left flapping like a lid by a piece of tanned scalp, which still adhered.
The interior cavities had also been stuffed with moss and lined with
clay, kneaded with blood from human veins, and the youth had
secured the skull to his shoulders by a twine of three strands made of
unbleached flax, of undyed wool, and of woman's hair, from which
also depended a raven black tress, which a wily crone had procured
from the maid he sought to obtain.... A silence, like that
of death, was around them, as they entered the open platting.
Nothing moved either in tree or brake. Through a space in the
foliage the stars were seen pale in heaven, and a crooked moon hung
in a bit of blue, amid motionless clouds. All was still and breathless
as if earth, heaven, and the elements were aghast.... Gasping,
and with cold sweat oozing on his brow, Plant recollected that they
were to shake the fern with a forked rod of witch hazel, and by no
means must touch it with their hands.... Plant drew his knife,
and stepping into a moonlighted bush, soon returned with what was
wanted, and then went forward. The green knowe [knoll], the old
oaks, the encircled space, and the fern were now approached; the
latter stiff and erect in a gleamy light.... Plant knelt on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
knee, and held his dish under the fern. Chirrup held his broad
plate next below, and Bangle knelt and rested the skull directly under
both on the green sod, the lid being up. Plant said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Good St. John, this seed we crave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have dared; shall we have?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">"A voice responded&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the moon is downward starting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moon and stars are now departing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quick, quick; shake, shake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He whose heart shall soonest break,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let him take.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">"They looked, and perceived by a glame that a venerable form, in a
loose robe, was near them.</p>

<p>"Darkness came down like a swoop. The fern was shaken; the
upper dish flew into pieces; the pewter one melted; the skull emitted
a cry, and eyes glared in its sockets; lights broke; beautiful children
were seen walking in their holiday clothes, and graceful female forms
sung mournful and enchanting airs. The men stood terrified and
fascinated; and Bangle, gazing, bade 'God bless 'em.' A crash
followed as if all the timber in the kloof was being splintered and torn
up; strange and horrid forms appeared from the thickets; the men
ran as if sped on the wind. They separated and lost each other."</p>

<p>Plant lay unconscious at home for three days, and "Chirrup was
found on the White Moss, raving mad and chasing the wild birds; as
for poor Bangle, he found his way home over hedge and ditch, running
with supernatural and fearful speed&mdash;the skull's eyes glaring at
his back, and the nether jaw grinning and jabbering frightful and
unintelligible sounds. He had preserved the seed, however, and,
having taken it from the skull, he buried the latter at the cross road
from whence he had taken it. He then carried the spell out, and his
proud love stood one night by his bedside in tears. But he had done
too much for human nature&mdash;in three months after she followed his
corpse, a real mourner, to the grave."</p>

<p>Kelly gives several illustrations of the varied forms in which the
superstitions respecting this "lightning plant" are presented in other
countries, which throw additional light upon some of the incidents in
Bamford's story. He says:&mdash;"Besides the powers already mentioned,
fern has others which distinctly mark its affinity with thunder and
lightning. 'In places where it grows the devil rarely practises his
glamour. He shuns and abhors the house and the place where it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and thunder, lightning and hail rarely fall there.'<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This is in apparent
contradiction with the Polish superstition, according to which
the plucking of fern produces a violent thunderstorm; but it is a
natural superstition, that the hitherto rooted and transformed thunderbolt
resumes its pristine nature, when the plant that contained it is
taken from the ground. In the Thuringian forest fern is called
<i>irrkracet</i>, or bewildering weed (from <i>irren</i>, to err, go astray), because
whoever treads on it unawares loses his wits, and knows not where
he is. In fact, he is in that condition of mind which we English
call 'thunderstruck,' and which Germans, Romans, and Greeks have
agreed in denoting by exactly corresponding terms. He has been
crazed by a shock from the lightning with which the fern is charged
like a Leyden jar. Instances of a similar phenomenon occur in the
legends of India and Greece."</p>

<p>The forms of beauty, referred to by Bamford as appearing amongst
the uncouth and "jabbering" sprites on this momentous occasion,
are suggestive of the legend of the "bright-day god" Baldr. Longfellow
says,&mdash;"Now the glad, leafy Midsummer, full of blossoms and
songs of nightingales is come! Saint John has taken the flowers
and festival of heathen Balder." It appears that Freyja, in exacting
an oath from all created things never to harm this "whitest and most
beloved of the gods," inadvertently overlooked one of the lightning
plants. It was an arrow formed from the branch of the mistletoe,
flung by the hand of the blind Hodr or Helder, with which Baldr was
struck dead. Baldr, says the legend, was buried in the true Scandinavian
fashion. His body was placed by the &AElig;sir on a funeral pyre,
raised on the deck of a ship, and whilst the former was in flames
the latter was floated seaward. The "St. John's-wort" seems to
have superseded the mistletoe in the modern tradition. As both were
"lightning plants," this however is not specially remarkable.</p>

<p>Ferns belong to the class <i>Cryptogamia</i>, or non-flowering plants.
They produce no seed, in a true sense, but fructify by means of the
sporules, or spores, deposited in <i>thec&aelig;</i>, on the under side of the fronds.
It was formerly believed that they did produce seed, and old botanists
describe it as "too minute and obscure" to be readily detected.
Singularly enough, the St. John's-wort (Hypericum), of which there
are several species found in Lancashire, is generally confounded in
these traditions with the <i>Osmunda Regalis</i>, or royal fern, or, as it is
sometimes improperly styled, the "<i>flowering</i> fern," which, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
is an absurdity, as expressing neither more nor less than the flowering
non-flowering plant! The name is said to be of Saxon origin,
Osmunda being one of the appellations of Thor, who, as we have previously
seen, was the "consecrator of marriage." The sporules are
very numerous and minute. The common St. John's-wort (<i>Hypericum
Vulgare.</i> Lin.) bears a yellow flower, and produces, of course, regular
seeds. Hill, in his "British Herbal," published in 1756, says, "A
tincture of the flower made strong in white wine is recommended
greatly by some against melancholy; but of these qualities we speak
with less certainty, though they deserve a fair trial."</p>

<p>Mr. John Ingram, in his "Flora Symbolica," says,&mdash;"Vervain,
or wild verbena, has been the floral symbol of enchantment from time
immemorial."</p>

<p>Ben Jonson says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bring your garlands, and with reverence place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vervain on the altar.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Ingram adds,&mdash;"In some country districts this small insignificant
flower still retains a portion of its old renown, and old folks
tie it round the neck to charm away the ague; with many it still has
the reputation of securing affection from those who take it to those
who administer it; and still in some parts of France do the peasantry
continue to gather the vervain, with ceremonies and words known
only to themselves; and to express its juices under certain phases of
the moon. At once the doctors and conjurors of their village, they
alternately cure the complaints of their masters or fill them with
dread; for the same means which relieve their ailments enable them
to cast a spell on their cattle and on the hearts of their daughters.
They insist that this power is given to them by vervain, especially
when the damsels are young and handsome. The vervain is still the
plant of spells and enchantments, as it was amongst the ancients."</p>

<p>A superstitious feeling yet prevails that the burning of fern attracts
rain. A copy of a royal proclamation is preserved in the British
Museum, enjoining the country people not to burn the fern on the
waysides during a "royal progress" of the merry monarch, Charles II.</p>

<p>The confusion which exists in the minds of the vulgar respecting
two very distinct classes of these plants, all, however, of lightning
origin in the Aryan mythology, is thus commented upon by Kelly:&mdash;"It
is also a highly significant fact that the marvellous root (St.
John's-wort) is said to be connected with fern; for the johnsroot or
john's hand is the root of a species of fern (<i>Polypodium Filix mas.</i> Lin.),
which is applied to many superstitious uses. The fern has large pinnate
fronds, and is thus related to the mountain ash and the mimos&aelig;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
In fact, says Kuhn, it were hardly possible to find in our climate a
plant which more accurately corresponds in its whole appearance to
the original signification of the Sanscrit name parna as leaf and
feather. Nor does the relationship between them end here, for fern,
Anglo-Saxon <i>fearn</i>, Old German <i>faram</i>, <i>farn</i>, and Sanscrit <i>parna</i>, are
one and the same word. It is also worthy of note that whereas one
of the German names of the rowan means boarash (eberesche), so
also there is a fern (<i>Polypodium Filix arboratica</i>) which is called in
Anglo-Saxon <i>eoferfarn</i>, <i>eferfarn</i>, that is boar-fern. In all the Indo-European
mythologies the boar is an animal connected with storm
and lightning."</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Waugh, in his "Sketches of Lancashire Life and
Localities," mentions a curious fact relative to this famous "Boggart
Ho' Clough," which is not without its significance. He says he was
informed that a lawyer, anxious to describe the locality in a legal
document, had found, on referring to some old title deeds, that a
"family of the name of 'Bowker' had formerly occupied a residence
situate in or near the clough; and that their dwelling was designated
'Bowker's Hall.'" The lawyer very naturally adopted this as the
true origin of the name. Yet Mr. Waugh informs us that the "testimony
of every writer who notices the spot, especially those best
acquainted with it, inclines to the other derivation."</p>

<p>Feeling some curiosity as to the true origin of this bit of local
nomenclature, I some time ago visited the place, in company with
Mr. Waugh. While we were resting at the farm-house at the head
of the clough, I asked a buxom maid if she had ever seen a boggart
in the neighbourhood. She candidly confessed that she had not.
On my pressing her hard as to whether she knew any one who had
been more fortunate, or unfortunate, as the case might be, she said
firmly, after a slight scrutiny of my countenance and figure&mdash;"Yes;
Sam Bamford has!" I put similar questions about an hour afterwards
to the maid at the "Bell" public-house, in Moston Lane,
which, to my surprise, elicited exactly similar responses. I pressed
this girl still further on the subject; and at length she frankly said,&mdash;"I
don't think any body, as I know, has sin a boggart i'th clough
except Bamford, 'bout it be Edwin Waugh. Ye've heard of him, no
doubt!" The girl was astounded on my informing her that Mr.
Waugh was present; and still more so when she witnessed the amusement
which his supposed interview with the redoubtable boggart
created amongst the party.</p>

<p>That there have existed traditions of boggarts, ghosts, &amp;c., in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
neighbourhood, as in other places, from time immemorial, cannot
admit of a doubt; but I nevertheless suspect that the corruption
referred to by Mr. Waugh has fixed the precise locality of, at least, one
of the stories to which I have referred. Once call a place "Boggart
Ho' Clough," and especially such a place, and I can easily imagine,
in a very short time, that many of the floating traditions of the neighbourhood
would fasten themselves upon it. This being afterwards
rendered more definite by the action of literary exponents of traditionary
lore, is quite sufficient to explain the whole of the phenomena
pertaining to the question in dispute. It must not be forgotten,
either, that by the vernacular appellation the clough is not necessarily
supposed to be haunted, but the "<i>hall</i>" merely, which stood in it, or
somewhere in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the line of the Roman Wall, to the north of Haltwhistle, Dr.
Collingwood Bruce speaks of "a gap of bold proportions having the
ominous name of Boglehole." Doubtless many other localities could
be pointed out where a nomenclature of a similar kind obtains, and
is still believed in by many not necessarily otherwise uneducated
people.</p>

<h3><small>THE SPECTRE HUNTSMAN AND THE FURIOUS HOST.</small></h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He the seven birds hath seen that never part,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seen the seven whistlers on their mighty rounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And counted them! And oftentimes will start,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>For overhead are sweeping Gabriel's hounds</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doomed with their <i>impious lord</i> the flying hart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To chase for ever on &auml;erial grounds.<br /></span>
</div><div class="rgt"><i>Wordsworth.</i></div></div>

<p class="mt2 noin">"<span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the most prominent of the demon superstitions prevalent
in Lancashire," says Mr. T. T. Wilkinson, "we may first instance
that of the Spectre Huntsman, which occupies so conspicuous a place
in the folk-lore of Germany and the north. This superstition is still
extant in the gorge of Cliviger, where he is believed to hunt a milk
white doe round the Eagle's Crag, in the vale of Todmorden, on
All Hallows Eve. His <i>hounds</i> are said to fly yelping through the air
on many other occasions, and, under the local name of '<i>Gabriel
Ratchets</i>,' are supposed to predict death or misfortune to all who hear
the sounds."</p>

<p>This superstition is known about Leeds, and other places in Yorkshire,
as "<i>Gabble Retchet</i>," and refers more especially to the belief
that the souls of unbaptised children are doomed to wander in this
stormy fashion about the homes of their parents.</p>

<p>These peculiar superstitions appear to have nearly died out, or to
have become merged into some other legends based on the action of
the Aryan storm-gods, Indra, Rudra, and their attendant Maruts or
Winds, both in Great Britain and Ireland. According to a writer in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, of July, 1836, the wild huntsman still lingers
in Devonshire. He says, "the spectre pack which hunts over Dartmoor
is called the 'wish hounds,' and the black 'master' who follows
the chase is no doubt the same who has left his mark on Wistman's
Wood," a neighbouring forest of dwarf oaks.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Holland, of Sheffield, referring to this superstition, in
1861, says, "I can never forget the impression made upon my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mind when once arrested by the cry of these Gabriel hounds as I
passed the parish church of Sheffield, one densely dark and very still
night. The sound was exactly like the greeting of a dozen beagles
on the foot of a race, but not so loud, and highly suggestive of ideas
of the supernatural." Mr. Holland has embodied the local feeling
on this subject in the following sonnet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 26em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oft have I heard my honoured mother say,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How she has listened to the Gabriel hounds&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Those strange unearthly and mysterious sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which on the ear through murkiest darkness fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And how, entranced by superstitions spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The trembling villager not seldom heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the quaint noise of the nocturnal bird<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of death premonished, some sick neighbour's knell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I, too, remember once at midnight dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How these sky-yelpers startled me and stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My fancy so, I could have then averred<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A mimic pack of beagles low did bark.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor wondered I that rustic fear should trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spectral huntsman doomed to that long moonless chase.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In classic mythology this wild hunt myth is parallelled by the
career of Orion, the "mighty hunter, the cloud raging in wild freedom
over hills and dales." Seeking to make the beautiful Aer&ocirc; his bride,
he is blinded by her father, who caught him asleep. After recovering
his sight by a journey towards the rising sun, he vainly endeavours
to seize upon and punish his enemy. In his wanderings he meets
with and is beloved by Artemis (Diana), one of the dawn-goddesses.
The Rev. G. W. Cox says, "It is but the story of the beautiful cloud
left in darkness when the sun goes down, but recovering its brilliance
when he rises again in the east." After his death, being so nearly
akin to the powers of light, Askl&ecirc;pios "seeks to raise him from the
dead, and thus brings on his own doom from the thunderbolts of
Zeus&mdash;a myth which points to the blotting out of the sun from the
sky by the thundercloud, just as he was rekindling the faded vapours
which lie motionless on the horizon." Orion's hound afterwards
became the dog-star, Sirius. Hence our name dog days for parching
weather.</p>

<p>This chasing of the white doe or the white hart by the spectre
huntsman has assumed various forms. According to Aristotle a
white hart was killed by Agathocles, king of Sicily, which a thousand
years beforehand had been consecrated to Diana by Diomedes.
Alexander the Great is said by Pliny to have caught a white stag,
placed a collar of gold about its neck, and afterwards set it free.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Succeeding heroes have, in after days, been announced as the
capturers of this famous white hart. Julius C&aelig;sar took the place of
Alexander, and Charlemagne caught a white hart at both Magdebourg,
and in the Holstein woods. In 1172, William the Lion is
reported to have accomplished a similar feat, according to a Latin
inscription on the walls of Lubeck Cathedral. Tradition says the
white hart has been caught on Rothwell Hay Common, in Yorkshire,
and in Windsor Forest.</p>

<p>Dean Stanley, in his "Historic Memorials of Westminster Abbey,"
informs us that the great northern entrance of that truly historic pile
was erected in the reign of Richard II., and that once "it contained his
well-known badge of the White Hart, which still remains, in colossal
proportions, on the fragile partition which shuts off the Muniment
Room from the southern triforium of the Nave." It appears that the
badge was first adopted in honour of his mother, Joan, the Fair Maid
of Kent, at a tournament in 1396. It had, however, direct reference
to the tradition which asserted that the famous white hart of C&aelig;sar
had been caught at Besastine, near Bagshot, in Windsor Forest.
Its identity was said to have been proved by a collar of gold about
its neck, which bore the following inscription:&mdash;"<i>Nemo me tangat:
C&aelig;saris sum.</i>" The badge was so popular amongst the friends of
Richard, that Bolingbroke, when Henry IV., had much difficulty in
suppressing it. Its frequent adoption as an inn sign is likewise
attributed to this circumstance.</p>

<p>In early Greek art, the deities of the morning, Athena, Apollo and
Artemis, are commonly, if not invariably, associated with a fawn
with a gleam of light on its breast. The hart in these legends appears
to typify the dawn, and, in conjunction with some other elements
of the myth, implies the daily sequence of light and darkness.</p>

<p>The spectre huntsman, so very popular in Scandinavian and German
tradition, is the Teutonic deity Odin or Woden, from whence our
Wednesday. Woden is claimed by the early Angle and Saxon kings of
the heptarchy as their common ancestor. This god had many names,
each descriptive of some special quality or attribute. Amongst others
he was styled Wunsch, from which we have the Anglo-Saxon wisk,
and the modern English wish, in the sense in which it is used in the
divining or wish-rod (German w&uuml;nschelruthe). In Devonshire the
term "wishtness" is still retained, and is employed to designate "all
unearthly creatures and their doings." Indra and Rudra are regarded
as the Aryan prototypes of Odin. Some of their chief characteristics
are retained in the doings of the "wild huntsman" and his followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
that form the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> of the "furious host." Kelly
describes the first phase of this legend as follows:</p>

<p>"Mounted on his white or dappled grey steed, the wild huntsman
may always be recognised by his broad-brimmed hat, and his wide
mantle, from which he is surnamed Hakelb&auml;rend or Hakelberg, an
old word signifying mantle-wearer. The hooting owl, Tutursel, flies
before him, and ravens, birds peculiarly sacred to Woden, accompany
the chase. Whoever sees it approach must fall flat on the ground,
or shelter himself under any odd number of boards, nine or eleven,
otherwise he will be borne away through the air and set down hundreds
of miles away from home, among people who speak a strange
tongue. It is still more dangerous to look out of the window when
Odin is sweeping by. The rash man is struck dead, or at least gets
a box on the ear that makes his head swell as big as a bucket, and
leaves a fiery mark on his cheek. In some instances the offender
has been struck blind or mad. There are certain places where Woden
is accustomed to feed his horse or let it graze, and in those places the
wind is always blowing. He has also a preference for certain tracks,
over which he hunts again and again at fixed seasons, from which
circumstance districts and villages in the old Saxon land received the
name of Woden's way. Houses and barns in which there are two or
three doors opposite each other are very liable to be made thoroughfares
by the wild hunt."</p>

<p>Mr. Baring-Gould, in his "Iceland, its Scenes and Sagas," describes
this superstition, as he heard it from his guide J&oacute;n, who related it to
him under the title of the "yule host." He says,&mdash;"Odin, or Wodin,
is the wild huntsman who nightly tears on his white horse over the
German and Norwegian forests and moor-sweeps, with his legion of
hell-hounds. Some luckless woodcutter, on a still night, is returning
through the pine woods; the air is sweet-scented with matchless pine
fragrance. Overhead the sky is covered with grey vapour, but a mist
is on all the land; not a sound among the fir tops; and the man
starts at the click of a falling cone. Suddenly his ear catches a distant
wail; a moan rolls through the interlacing branches; nearer and
nearer comes the sound. There is the winding of a long horn waxing
louder and louder, the baying of hounds, the rattle of hoofs and paws
on the pine tree tops. A blast of wind rolls along, the firs bend as
withes, and the woodcutter sees the wild huntsman and his rout
reeling by in frantic haste.... The wild huntsman chases the
wood spirits, and he is to be seen at cock-crow returning with the
little Dryads hanging to his saddle-bow by their yellow locks."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The personification of the strife of the elements in stormy weather
is here very apparent. As the name of Odin or other of his special
appellations became lost or corrupted, mysterious personages, or
heroes of another and more mortal stamp, became confounded with
the spectre huntsman. Herod, the murderer of the Jewish children,
is evidently referred to by the French peasants of Perigord, when they
speak of "La chasse Herode." This seems to have resulted from the
corruption of Hr&ocirc;dso (the renowned), one of the titles applied to Odin.</p>

<p>At Blois, the wild hunt is called the "chasse Maccabei," from the
following supposed reference to it in the Bible:&mdash;"Then it happened
that through all the city, for the space almost of forty days, there
were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed
with lances like a band of soldiers. And troops of horsemen in array,
encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields
and multitudes of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts,
and glittering of golden ornaments and harness of all sorts. Wherefore
every man prayed that that apparition might turn to good."
(II. Maccabeus, v. 2 to 4.)</p>

<p>In Brittany and Picardy the peasants, in the midst of sudden storms
or whirlwinds, which throw down trees and steeples, are still in the
habit of crossing themselves, and exclaiming "<i>C'est le juif errant qui
passe</i>." This evidently demonstrates that the legendary story of the
Wandering Jew, the spectre hunt of Odin, and the superstitions
associated with the seven whistlers, have been confounded or
"dovetailed," as it were, one into the other. Indeed, in its combined
form, remnants may yet be found in Lancashire. Mr. James
Pearson, in a contribution to "Notes and Queries," of September
30th, 1871, testifies to this in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Seven Whistlers.</span>&mdash;One evening a few years ago, when crossing
one of our Lancashire moors, in company with an intelligent old
man, we were suddenly startled by the whistling overhead of a covey
of plovers. My companion remarked that when a boy the old people
considered such a circumstance a bad omen, 'as the person who heard
<i>the Wandering Jews</i>,' as he called the plovers, 'was sure to be overtaken
with some ill luck.' On questioning my friend on the name
given to the birds, he said, 'There is a tradition that they contain the
souls of those Jews who assisted at the crucifixion, and in consequence
were doomed to float in the air for ever.' When we arrived at the
foot of the moor, a coach, by which I had hoped to complete my
journey, had already left its station, thereby causing me to finish the
distance on foot. The old man reminded me of the omen."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Another writer, "A. S.," in "Notes and Queries," October 21, 1871,
says:&mdash;"During a thunderstorm which passed over this district"
(Kettering, in Yorkshire), "on the evening of September 6, on which
occasion the lightning was very vivid, an unusual spectacle was
witnessed; immense flocks of birds were flying about, uttering doleful
affrighted cries, as they passed over the locality, and for hours they
kept up a continual whistling like that made by sea birds. There
must have been great numbers of them, as they were also observed at
the same time, as we learn by the public prints, in the counties of
Northampton, Leicester, and Lincoln. The nest day, as my servant
was driving me to a neighbouring village, this phenomenon of the
flight of birds became the subject of conversation, and on asking him
what birds he thought they were he told me they were what were
called <i>The Seven Whistlers</i>, and that whenever they were heard it
was considered a sign of some great calamity, and that the last time
he heard them was the night before the great Hartley colliery explosion;
he had also been told by soldiers that if they heard them they
always expected a great slaughter would take place soon. Curiously
enough, on taking up the newspaper the following morning, I saw
headed in large letters&mdash;'Terrible Colliery Explosion at Wigan,' etc.,
etc. This I thought would confirm my man's belief in 'the Seven
Whistlers.'"</p>

<p>I have heard it seriously asserted in discussion by geologists and
mining engineers, that a low state of the barometer generally, if not
invariably, accompanies a certain class of accidents in coal pits.
Perhaps this peculiar atmospheric condition may explain the coincidences
referred to.</p>

<p>Another contributor of the same date, "Viator," gives the following
Eastern illustration of this superstition,&mdash;"It strikes me as curious
that Mr. Pearson should hear on a Lancashire moor a tradition or
superstition so similar to that which I have heard on the Bosphorus
with reference to certain flocks of birds, about the size of a thrush,
which fly up and down the channel, and are never seen to rest on the
land or water. I was informed by the man who rowed the <i>caique</i> that
they were the souls of the damned, and condemned to perpetual
motion."</p>

<p>There is a legend of Odin wandering over the earth, accompanied
by his two ravens, one of which represented Thought and the other
Memory. Mr. Princeps had a picture in the Royal Academy Exhibition
in 1871, illustrating this tradition.</p>

<p>The last time the Wandering Jew is said to have appeared <i>in propri&acirc;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
person&acirc;</i> was in the year 1604, when he was believed to have been seen
three times in France. As his appearance was invariably accompanied
with violent and destructive tempests, the peasantry concluded that his
mode of locomotion was of a supernatural character, and that the fierce
blasts of the storm-god (or fiend) hurled him from place to place. Since
the French visits referred to, it seems that the Wandering Jew's advent
has not been able to gain much credence. Several times, however,
attempts in this direction have been made. Referring to the subject,
Brand says:&mdash;"I remember to have seen one of these imposters some
years ago in the north of England, who made a very hermit-like
appearance, and went up and down the streets of Newcastle with a
long train of boys at his heels, muttering, 'Poor John alone, alone!'
I thought he pronounced his name in a manner singularly plaintive."
In a note Brand adds that "Poor John alone" is "otherwise 'Poor
Jew alone.'" He mentions a portrait of this man, painted for Sir
William Musgrave, Bart., which was inscribed "Poor Joe alone!" which
corresponds with the name of a then recent pretender of this class,
as recorded by Matthew Paris, on the authority of an Armenian archbishop,
who, in 1228, visited the monastery at St. Albans.</p>

<p>The earlier gods of the heathens were supposed, notwithstanding
their immortality, to be occasionally subjected to a kind of temporary
death. Baldr, the bright day-god, was slain by a stroke of a mistletoe
branch, wielded by the hand of the blind Hodr; the Python overcame
Apollo; and such is sometimes the strange inconsistency of early
traditions and their after development, that the grave of Zeus was a
sacred spot to the Ancient Greeks. The spectre huntsman appears
to have been subjected to some such death, or protracted trance,
periodically.</p>

<p>Odin rode on his dappled grey steed only in rough weather. His
mortal enemy seems to have been the wild boar. This animal is also
a favourite mythic form of expression in Merlin's famous prophesy.
The Germans have a legend that in the form of Hackelberg, or the
mantle-wearer, on one occasion he was heard to inquire for the
"stumpy tail" that he knew from a vision was destined to overcome
him. At a great hunt he killed the animal, and fancied that he had
practically given the lie to his dream of the previous night. In his
triumph he kicked the slain brute contemptuously; but the tusk of
the dead animal (an Aryan personification of the lightning) piercing
his leg, inflicted a wound, from the effects of which he died, or, in
other words, fell into a deep trance. This evidently represents the
season of calm weather, during which the spectre huntsman and his
howling pack rest from their labours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>This wild boar legend has near mythological affinity to the
Greek one, respecting Adonis, who, whilst hunting, was mortally
wounded in the thigh by a wild boar. The waters of the river Adonis
assume, at a certain season of the year, a deep red hue, which was
said to be caused by the blood of Adonis. Modern investigation has
attributed this phenomenon to periodical heavy rains, which bring
large quantities of red earth into the river. In Syria, Thammuz, an
older prototype or counterpart of Adonis, was worshipped, which
worship was denounced by Ezekiel, six centuries before Christ, as
amongst the abominations of Judah. Milton, in "Paradise Lost,"
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thammuz came next behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In amorous ditties all a summer's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Thammuz yearly wounded.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Adonis alternately abode with Aphrodit&ecirc; in heaven and Persephon&ecirc;
in hell. This has been held to be "typical of the burial of seed,
which, in due season, rises above the ground for the propagation of
its species," or of the "annual passage of the sun from the northern
to the southern hemisphere."</p>

<p>Odin was surnamed the lord of the gallows, or the god of the
hanged, because human sacrifices were offered to him in this fashion,
and because he had hanged himself for nine days on the mighty tree
Yggdrasil. Hence the superstition in Germany, and not unknown
in England, that the act of committing suicide by hanging creates a
storm.</p>

<p>The temporary death, or state of coma, of these weather-gods is
very significant. When Indra or Odin hurled his spear, the weapon,
with most commendable loyalty, as a rule, returned to the hand of its
proprietor. Thor's hammer or lightning club, was, generally, equally
accommodating. But at the conclusion of the autumnal storms,
the implement remained buried in the earth, where, like some animals,
it may be said to have hybernated. It was not until the return of
spring that the potent weapon was restored to the grasp of the
thundering deity.</p>

<p>The analogy of the weapons of these gods to the lightning is
forcibly illustrated by the Scandinavian legend, which asserts that
Odin lent his spear in the form of a reed to King Erich in order to
ensure him the victory in a battle against Styrbj&ouml;rn. The reed, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
its flight, assumed the form of a spear, and <i>struck with blindness</i> the
whole of the opposing army.</p>

<p>The peculiar form of this weapon of the gods has undergone many
changes in mythical lore. It is the sword of Roland, "Durandal,"
which Mr. Cox says "is manifestly the sword of Chrys&acirc;&ocirc;r." It is
that of Theseus and that of Sigurd. It is Arthur's famous sword
"Excalibur," as well as the one which no one could draw from the
iron anvil sheath, embedded in stone, but himself. It is Odin's sword,
"Gram," stuck in the roof tree of Volsung's hall. Mr. Cox says:&mdash;"Like
all other sons of Helios, Arthur has his enemies, and King
Rience demands as a sign of homage the beard of Arthur, which
gleams with the splendour of the golden locks or rays of Phoibos
Akersekomes. The demand is refused, but in the medi&aelig;val romance
there is room for others who reflect the glory of Arthur, while his
own splendour is for a time obscured. At Camelot they see a maiden
with a sword attached to her body, which Arthur himself cannot draw.
In the Knight Balin, who draws it, and who 'because he was poorly
arrayed put him not far in the press,' we see not merely the humble
Arthur, who gives his sword to Sir Kay, but Odysseus, who in his
beggar's dress shrinks from the brilliant throng that crowds his
ancestral hall." Campbell, in his "Tales of the West Highlands,"
says:&mdash;"The Manx hero, Olave, of Norway, had a sword with a
Celtic name, Macabuin." It reappears in many of the fairy tales.
In some popular stories it becomes an ordinary cudgel, with magical
properties, leaps of its own accord out of the lad's bag who owned it,
and severely punishes the rascally innkeeper who stole the buck-goat
that spat gold, the hen that laid the golden eggs, and a table that
covered itself with a sumptuous repast, without human aid. The
stick, like Indra's spear, returned to its owner's hand on the completion
of the innkeeper's castigation. Different versions of the
legend are found in Yorkshire, Germany, and various other parts of
Europe. Kelly says:&mdash;"The table, in this story, is the all-nourishing
cloud. The buck-goat is another emblem of the clouds, and the
gold it spits is the golden light of the sun that streams through the
fleecy covering of the sky. The hen's golden egg is the sun itself.
The demon of darkness has stolen these things; the cloud gives no
rain, but hangs dusky in the sky, veiling the light of the sun. Then
the lightning spear of the ancient storm-god, Odin, leaps out from
the bag that concealed it (the cloud again), the robber falls, the rain
patters down, the sun shines once more." In other words we have
the Sanscrit Vritra, the dragon, or "dark thief," stealing the herds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of Indra, and hiding them in the cave of the Panis (the dark cloud),
and the weapon of the lightning-god effecting their liberation.</p>

<p>It is said that, in the "elevated and inland region of Arya, the
winter was a rigorous season of seven months' duration, and it has
been suggested that the dormant condition of the lightning, or the
sun-god's weapon, is symbolical of the fact." Lyell and others contend
that geological evidence indicates that the winters were long and
severe during the period when the makers of the "pal&aelig;oliths," or
rude flint implements, which have recently attracted so much attention,
lived on the banks of the Somme, near Amiens and Abbeville, and
in other localities in England and Northern Europe. These implements
are believed to furnish the most reliable evidence of the earliest existence
of man yet discovered. If such was the condition of the country on
the arrival of the Aryan emigrants, four different classes of facts&mdash;mythological,
philological, geological, and arch&aelig;ological&mdash;seem to be
in perfect harmony with each other.</p>

<p>Kelly says, "in some places local tradition makes Hackelberg a
mere man; in others an enormous giant. At Rocklum, near Wolfenbuttel,
the existence of a group of hills is accounted for by saying that
they are composed of the gravel which Hackelberg once threw out of
his shoe as he passed that way with the wild hunt." Similar
traditions are not unknown in Lancashire and other parts of Britain.
It is stated in Knight's "Old England" that "there were formerly
three huge upright stones near Kennet, not far from Abury, the
country people called them from time immemorial, 'The Devil's
Coits.' They could be playthings, it might readily be imagined, for
no other busy idler. But the good folks of Somersetshire, by a sort
of refinement of such hacknied traditions, hold that a great stone,
near Stanton Drew, now called '<i>Hackell's Coit</i>,' and which formerly
weighed thirty tons, was thrown from a hill about a mile off, by a
mortal champion, Sir Jno. Hautville."</p>

<p>Dr. J. Collingwood Bruce, in his "Wallet-Book of the Roman
Wall," relates the following Northumberland tradition:&mdash;"To the
north of Sewingshields, two strata of sandstone crop out to the day;
the highest points of each ledge are called the King and Queen's-crag,
from the following legend. King Arthur, seated on the furthest rock,
was talking with his queen, who, meanwhile, was engaged in arranging
her 'back-hair.' Some expression of the queen's having offended his
majesty, he seized a rock which lay near him, and, with an exertion
of strength for which the Picts were proverbial, he threw it at her, a
distance of about a quarter of a mile! The queen, with great dexterity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
caught it upon her comb, and thus warded off the blow; the
stone fell between them, where it lies to this very day, with the marks
of the comb upon it, to attest the truth of the story. It probably
weighs about twenty tons."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>This method of accounting for the deposition of the large boulders
and other erratic rocks of the glacial drift period of modern geology
is common in Lancashire and the North of England. Odin, or
Hackelberg, is, of course, in these legends, converted into the devil,
as in Kennet. He is supposed to have built a bridge over the Kent,
a little above Kendal, and another over the Lune, at Kirkby Lonsdale;
and it is said that in leaping from the hills on the Yorkshire side of
the valley into Lancashire, his apron string broke, and a large mass
of scattered rocks which lie in the valley fell to the earth in consequence.
The present writer was once shown, near Hutton Roof, a
hollow in the mountain limestone of which the hill is formed, which
he was seriously told had been named, from time immemorial, the
"Devil's Footprint," and was still held to be irrefragable evidence of
the truth of the legend referred to. The hole in the rock did certainly
bear some slight resemblance to the impression of a cow's hoof on
some plastic substance; but it in reality is an ordinary limestone
cavity, of a somewhat unusual form.</p>

<p>The removing of stones in the night by the devil on the occasion of the
building of churches appears to have some remote connection with the
ancient superstition now under consideration. Lancashire has many
such stories. The wild boar, or demon pig, played some such pranks at
Winwick. A rude sculpture, "resembling a hog fastened to a block by
the collar," has been found amongst the carved stones which decorated
the ancient church. In this, Mr. E. Baines says, "superstition sees
the resemblance of a monster in former ages, which prowled over the
neighbourhood, inflicting injury on man and beast, and which could
only be restrained by the subduing power of the sacred edifice." Mr.
T. T. Wilkinson says "The Goblin Builders" are "said to have
removed the foundations of Rochdale Church from the banks of the
river Roach up to their present elevated position. Samlesbury Church
near Preston, possesses a similar tradition. The demon pig not
only determined the site of St. Oswald's Church at Winwick, but
gave a name to the parish.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The parochial church at Burnley, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
is said, was originally intended to be built on the site of the old
Saxon cross, in Godly-lane; but, however much the masons might
have built during the day, both the stones and the scaffolding were
invariably found where the church now stands, on their coming to
work next morning. The local legend states that on this occasion
also, the goblin took the form of a <i>pig</i>, and a rude sculpture of such
an animal, on the south side of the steeple, lends its aid to perpetuate
and confirm the story."</p>

<p>Miss Farington, in her paper on Leyland Church, read before
the Lancashire and Cheshire Historic Society, refers to several carved
stones which decorated the ancient structure, and amongst others to
what was termed the "cat stone." She says&mdash;"To this relic
appends the usual story of the stones being removed by night (in
this case from Whittle to Leyland), and the devil, in the form of a
<i>cat</i>, throttling a person who was bold enough to watch." This tradition
I have often heard spoken of myself by the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The cat, as I have shown in a previous chapter, like the boar, was
an Aryan personification of storm and tempest.</p>

<p>When the Hackelberg-Odin was killed by the boar's tusk, in accordance
with his last request, he was interred at the spot to which his
favourite steed unguided bore him. He is believed to have been
buried in the "enchanted or cloud mountain," which the superstitious,
however, still insist upon finding on the earth. He is supposed
to lie in a secluded spot on some lone moorland side, the way to
which no curious enquirer ever trod a second time. Hence the many
traditions of heroes slumbering in caves, awaiting the signal for
future battle, and their triumph over the enchantment that has held
them for ages spell-bound. Frederic Barbarossa&mdash;he of the red
beard like Odin&mdash;is yet believed by the German peasantry to rest in
a cavern, surrounded by his knights, in the Kyffh&auml;user mountain,
"leaning his head upon his arm, at a table through which his beard
has grown, or around which, according to other accounts, it has
grown twice. When it has thrice encircled the table he will awake
up to battle. The cavern glitters with gold and jewels, and is as
bright as the sunniest day. Thousands of horses stand at mangers
filled with thorn bushes instead of hay, and make a prodigious noise
as they stamp on the ground and rattle their chains. The old Kaiser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sometimes wakes up for a moment and speaks to his visitors. He
once asked a herdsman who had found his way into the Kyffh&auml;user,
'Are the ravens [Odin's birds] still flying about the mountain?' The
man replied that they were. 'Then,' said Barbarossa, 'I must
sleep a hundred years longer.'" From many details in this superstition,
Mannhardt clearly identifies Frederic and his companions
with Odin and his wild host.</p>

<p>Similar stories are told of the Emperor Henry the Fowler, who is
said to be entranced in the Sudemerberg, near Goslar. Charlemagne
and his enchanted army are believed to slumber in several different
localities. In Britain, Armorica, Normandy, and other places, the
caverned hero, who has superseded Odin, is the renowned Arthur,
who is expected yet to reappear, and restore the glory of the ancient
British race. Grimm shows that the medi&aelig;val Germans believed
that "Arthur, too, the vanished King, whose return is expected by
the Britons, and who rides at the head of the nightly host, is said to
dwell with his men at arms in a mountain; Felicia, Sybilla's
daughter, and the goddess Juno, live with him, and the whole army
are well provided with food, drink, horses, and clothes."</p>

<p>It appears that the earliest poetical writer in the English vernacular,
at the commencement of the thirteenth century, Layamon,
in his "Brut or Chronicle of Britain, a Poetical Semi-Saxon Paraphrase
of the Brut of Wace," first engrafted this legend on the Arthurian
romances. According to him, Arthur, when dying, addressed
Constantine, his successor, as follows:&mdash;"I will fare to Avalun to the
fairest of all maidens, to Argante, the Queen, an elf most fair, and
she shall make my wounds all sound; make me all whole with
healing draughts. And afterwards I will come again to my
kingdom and dwell with the Britons with mickle joy." Layamon
further adds:&mdash;"Even with the words there approached from the sea
a little short boat floating with the waves, and two women therein
wondrously formed; and they took Arthur anon, and bare him
quickly, and laid him softly down, and forth they gan depart. Then
was it accomplished that Merlin whilom said, that mickle care
should come of Arthur's departure. The Britons believe yet that he
is alive and dwelleth in Avalun with the fairest of all elves, and the
Britons even yet expect when Arthur shall return." Amongst the
Welsh bards, after the appearance of Geoffrey's History, fairy land
was designated "Ynys yr Avallon," or the "Island of the Apple
Trees."</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in his "Demonology and Witchcraft," relates a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
tradition, in which he makes Thomas the Rhymer the hero, but this
Kelly contends is a blunder, and cites the following passage, quoted
by Sir Walter himself, from Leyden's "Scenes of Infancy," in proof
of his view that the caverned warriors referred to were King Arthur's
Knights:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Say who is he with summons loud and long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall bid the charmed sleep of ages fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll the long sound through Eildon's caverns vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While each dark warrior kindles at the blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horn, the falchion grasp with mighty hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peal proud Arthur's march from Fairy land?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Sir Walter Scott's version of the legend is as follows:&mdash;"A daring
horse-jockey sold a black horse to a man of venerable and antique
appearance, who appointed the remarkable hillock upon Eildon Hills,
called the Lucken Hare, as the place where, at twelve o'clock at night
he should receive the price. He came, his money was paid in ancient
coin, and he was invited by his customer to view his residence. The
trader in horses followed his guide in the deepest astonishment
through several long ranges of stalls, in each of which a horse stood
motionless, while an armed warrior lay equally still at the charger's feet.
'All these men,' said the wizard in a whisper, 'will awaken at the
battle of Sheriffmoor.' At the extremity of this extraordinary dep&ocirc;t
hung a sword and a horn, which the prophet pointed out to the horse
dealer as containing the means of dissolving the spell. The man, in
confusion, took the horn and attempted to wind it. The horses
instantly started in their stalls, stamped, and shook their bridles, the
men arose and clashed their armour, and the mortal, terrified at the
tumult he had excited, dropped the horn from his hand. A voice
like that of a giant, louder even than the tumult around, pronounced
these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woe to the coward that ever he was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That did not draw the sword before he blew the horn!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin"><i>A whirlwind</i> expelled the horse dealer from the cavern, the entrance
to which he could never find again."</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Kirkoswald, on the Eden, in Cumberland,
a district prolific in Arthurian legends, it is said that "a peculiar wind
called the <i>Helmwind</i>, sometimes blows with great fury in this part of
the country. It is believed by some persons to be an electrical
phenomenon." Perhaps this fact may have some remote connection
with the superstition under consideration.</p>

<p>Sir Walter remarks that although his legend refers to Sheriffmoor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and 1715, a similar story is related in the reign of Elizabeth by
Reginald Scot. Indeed, it is told with some variations in several
localities, both in the Highlands and in the northern counties of
England. In Hodgson's "Northumberland" it is described in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Immemorial tradition has asserted that King Arthur, his queen,
Guenever, his court of lords and ladies, and his hounds, were enchanted
in some cave of the crags, or in a hall below the castle of
Sewingshields, and would continue entranced there till some one
should first blow a bugle-horn, that lay on a table near the entrance
of the hall, and then, with 'the sword of the stone,' cut a garter,
also placed there beside it. But none had ever heard where the
entrance to this enchanted hall was, till the farmer at Sewingshields,
about fifty years since, was sitting knitting on the ruins of the castle,
and his clew fell, and ran downwards through a rush of briers and
nettles, as he supposed, into a deep subterranean passage. Full in
the faith that the entrance into King Arthur's hall was now discovered,
he cleared the briery portal of its weeds and rubbish, and,
entering a vaulted passage, followed, in his darkling way, the thread
of his clew. The floor was infested with toads and lizards; and the
dark wings of bats, disturbed by his unhallowed intrusion, flitted
fearfully around him. At length his sinking courage was strengthened
by a dim, distant light, which, as he advanced, grew gradually brighter,
till, all at once, he entered a vast and vaulted hall, in the centre of
which, a fire without fuel, from a broad crevice in the floor, blazed
with a high and lambent flame, that showed all the carved walls and
fretted roof, and the monarch and his queen and court reposing
around, in a theatre of thrones and costly couches. On the floor,
beyond the fire, lay the faithful and <i>deep-toned pack of thirty couple of
hounds</i>; and, on a table before it, the spell-dissolving horn, sword,
and garter. The shepherd reverently, but firmly, grasped the sword,
and as he drew it leisurely from its rusty scabbard, the eyes of the
monarch and his courtiers began to open, and they rose till they sat
upright. He cut the garter; and, as the sword was being slowly
sheathed, the spell assumed its ancient power, and they all sank
gradually to rest; but not before the monarch had lifted up his eyes
and hands, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O woe betide that evil day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which this witless wight was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who drew the sword&mdash;the garter cut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never blew the bugle-horn.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>Terror brought on loss of memory, and the shepherd was unable to
give any correct account of his adventure, or to find again the
entrance to the enchanted hall."</p>

<p>The Arthur legend is repeated, with some slight variations, by the
country people about Alderley Edge, Cheshire. The sleeping warriors
are said to repose in the recesses of a place called the "Wizard's
Cave."</p>

<p>An old Cornish legend avers that King Arthur is still alive in the
form of a raven; and certain superstitious people refuse to shoot
these birds, from a fear that they might inadvertently destroy the
mythic warrior.</p>

<p>King Arthur and his knights have been so popular in Lancashire,
that the Rev. John Whitaker, the historian of Manchester, seriously
relates the story of Sir Tarquin and Lancelot of the Lake as an
historical event pertaining to this county. According to him, Tarquin's
castle was at Manchester, and the lake from which Sir Lancelot derived
his surname the now almost thoroughly drained Martin Mere.
He contends that discovered remains demonstrate that three of the
battles won by Arthur, and ascribed by tradition to the neighbourhood
of the Douglas, were fought near Wigan and Blackrod. Geoffrey of
Monmouth, however, only mentions one battle as being fought on the
banks of the Douglas. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Saxons, under the command of Colgrin, were attempting to
exterminate the whole of the British race. They had also entirely
subdued all that part of the island which extends from the Humber
to the sea of Caithness.... Hereupon he (Arthur) marched
to (towards) York, of which, when Colgrin had intelligence, he met
him with a very great army, composed of Saxons, Scots, and Picts,
<i>by the river Duglas</i>, where a battle happened with the loss of the
greater part of both armies. Notwithstanding, the victory fell to
Arthur, who pursued Colgrin to York, and there besieged him."</p>

<p>The "historical" Arthur, however, has long been looked upon by
the best historians as a mythical or fictitious personage, the representative,
or impersonation as it were, of the national valour and
superstition.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Dr. Kuhn and others regard all the stories of these
caverned heroes as merely relatively modernised forms of Odin
and his terrible host. They refer the weapon suspended in the
cave to "that of Heimdallr, the Sverd&acirc;s or sword-god, and warder
of Bifrost Bridge," to whom belongs the "Gjallar horn with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
he will warn the gods that the frost giants are advancing to storm
Valhalla." The mighty conflict in which they expect to be engaged
"will be fought before the end of the world, when heaven and earth
shall be destroyed, and the &AElig;sir gods themselves shall perish, and
their places shall be filled by a new creation and new and brighter
gods." This dark myth is by some writers regarded as a foreshadowing
of the downfall of paganism and the advent of a higher civilisation
and purer religion under the Christian dispensation.</p>

<p>Tempests and the howling of the wind appear to have been regarded
with superstitious reverence from the earliest times in the British
islands. Plutarch speaks of the return to Delphos from Britain of
a certain grammarian, named Demetrius, who related some curious
stories with respect to the then but little known country. Amongst
other things the travelled sage narrated to Plutarch and his friends
the following story:&mdash;"There are many desert islands scattered about
Britain, some of which have the name of being the islands of genii
and heroes; that he had been sent by the emperor, for the sake of
describing and viewing them, to that which lay nearest to the desert
isles, and which had but few inhabitants; all of whom were esteemed
by the Britons sacred and inviolable. Very soon after his arrival
there was great turbulence in the air, and many portentous storms;
the winds became tempestuous, and fiery whirlwinds rushed forth.
When these ceased, the islanders said that the departure of some one
of the superior genii had taken place. For, as a light when burning,
say they, has nothing disagreeable, but when extinguished, is offensive
to many; so likewise lofty spirits afford an illumination benignant
and mild, but their extinction and destruction frequently, as at the
present moment, excite winds and storms, and often infect the atmosphere
with pestilential evils. Moreover, that there was one island
there, where Saturn was confined by Briareus in sleep: for that sleep
had been devised for his bonds; and that around him were many
genii as his companions and attendants."</p>

<p>Singularly enough, M. Du Chaillu, in his "Journey to Ashango-land,"
found a similar superstition to obtain amongst the West Coast
Equatorial Africans. They believe that the Oguisi or "spirit" brings
the plague amongst them in the form of a whirlwind. An impression
got abroad that the white man who was advancing into their territories
was the veritable Oguisi, and consequently, owing to their fetich
superstition, they expected disaster therefrom. He says:&mdash;"The King
of the Niembouai, like most of the other monarchs of these regions,
did not show himself on my arrival&mdash;he was absent until about noon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to-day. I have been told that the reason why the chiefs keep away
from the villages until I have been in them some time is, that they
have a notion that I bring with me a whirlwind which may do them
some great harm; so they wait until it has had time to blow away
from the village before they make their appearance."</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the tradition of the "wild hunt,"
or the "furious host," has become obsolete, or nearly so, in Ireland,
inasmuch as that country has preserved, with much minuteness,
many other Aryan myths. What does remain in Ireland, however,
is singularly in accordance with the properties assigned to the elder
storm-gods, Indra and Rudra, and their followers, the Ribhus and
the Maruts, in the Rig Veda.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, in 1847, makes the following observations:&mdash;"The
ideas of the Irish peasantry respecting the state of
departed souls are very singular. According to the tenets of the
church to which the majority of them belong, the souls of the departed
are either in paradise, hell, or purgatory. But popular belief
assigns the air as a fourth place of suffering, where unquiet souls
wander about until their period of penance is past. On a cold, or
wet, or stormy night, the peasant will exclaim with real sympathy
'Musha! God help the poor souls that are in the shelter of the
ditches, or under the eaves this way!' And the good 'chanathee' or
mother of a family will sweep the hearth, that the poor souls may
warm themselves when the family retires. The conviction that the
spirits of the departed sweep along with the storm or shiver in the
driving rain, is singularly wild and near akin to the Scandinavian
myth." The identity of this superstition with some of the Aryan
myths, is very easily perceived. Kelly says:&mdash;"Indra has for friends
and followers the Maruts, or spirits of the winds, whose host consists,
at least in part, of the souls of the pious dead; and the Ribhus, who
are of similar origin, but whose element is rather that of the sunbeams
or the lightning, though they too rule the winds, and sing
like the Maruts the loud song of the storm."</p>

<p>The same writer gives the following graphic description of the
popular feeling and action on the approach of this mythic cavalcade:&mdash;"The
first token which the furious host gives of its approach is a low
song that makes the hearer's flesh creep. The grass and the leaves
of the forest wave and bow in the moonshine as often as the strain
begins anew. Presently the sounds come nearer and nearer, and swell
into the music of a thousand instruments. Then bursts the hurricane,
and the oaks of the forest come crashing down. The spectral appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
often presents itself in the shape of a great black coach, on which
sit hundreds of spirits singing a wonderfully sweet song. Before it
goes a man, who loudly warns everybody to get out of the way. All
who hear him must instantly drop down with their faces to the
ground, as at the coming of the wild hunt, and hold fast by something,
were it only a blade of grass; for the furious host has been
known to force many a man into its coach and carry him hundreds
of miles away through the air."</p>

<p>The black coach version of the legend of the furious host yet
survives in the North of England. Mr. Henderson says:&mdash;"Night
after night, too, when it is sufficiently dark, the headless coach whirls
along the rough approach to Langley Hall, near Durham, drawn by
black and fiery steeds." In a work entitled "Rambles in Northumberland,"
it is referred to in the following terms:&mdash;"When the
death-hearse, drawn by headless horses, and driven by a headless
driver, is seen about midnight, proceeding rapidly, but without noise,
towards the churchyard, the death of some considerable person in the
parish is sure to happen at no distant period." It is likewise referred
to in Rees's Diary as a "vision of a coach drawn by six black swine, and
driven by a black driver."</p>

<p>Grose says:&mdash;"We sometimes read of ghosts striking violent blows;
and that, if not made way for, they overturn all impediment, <i>like a
furious whirlwind</i>." Yet singularly enough in the same paragraph,
speaking on the authority of Glanvil of the apparition of an old
woman, he informs us that "if a tree stood in her walk," the spectator
"observed her always to go through it." Notwithstanding this
feat, the old lady must have had some materiality about her, for on
being lifted from the ground by human hands at her request, her
ghostship "felt just like a bag of feathers."</p>

<p>"The furious host" seems to have differed in some legends from
the "wild hunt" of Odin and his followers, and yet in others they
appear as it were in combination. Indeed, the name Woden, itself,
signifies the "Furious One;" and hence, doubtless, we have the link
which legitimately connects them together. "<i>Wud</i>" still signifies
"mad" in some existing Scottish dialects. The hounds of the
"spectre huntsman" are believed to be human souls transformed into
air; which in their wild career strip the hedges of the linen placed
there to dry; they eat up or scatter abroad meal and the ashes that
lay on the peasant's hearth. The hound sometimes left behind in
the household, through which the wild hunt has passed, is supposed
to repose on the hearth for a whole year, during which time it lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
upon ashes, and howls and whines, until the spectre horseman returns,
when it jumps on its feet, wags its tail with joy, and rejoins its
ancient comrades. Kelly says:&mdash;"There is only one way amongst
the Germans of ridding the house sooner of the unwelcome guest,
and that is to brew beer in eggshells. The hound watches the operation
and exclaims</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though I am now as old as the old Bohemian wold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the like of this I ween, in my life I ne'er have seen.<br /></span>

<p class="noin">And it goes, and is seen no more. On Christmas evenings especially,
that is to say, at the season of the winter solstice, it is very unsafe to
leave linen hanging out of doors, for the wild huntsman's hounds will
tear it to pieces." The soughing of the wind through crevices, windows,
or doorways in buildings, or narrow passages in the hills, like
that at Cliviger, was believed to be the howling of Odin's hounds, and
to indicate the passage of "the furious host."</p>

<p>This spectre hound or dog is a very common sprite in Lancashire.
I remember well being terrified in my youth in Preston, by Christmas
recitals of strange stories of its appearance, and the misfortune which
its howling was said to forebode. The Preston black dog was without
a head, which rendered the said howling still more mysterious to my
youthful imagination. A gentleman recently related to me a story
respecting this "dog-fiend," which he had direct from a Manchester
tradesman's own lips, who thoroughly believed in the supernatural
character of his nocturnal assailant. This tradesman, a Mr. Drabble,
assured my friend that the celebrated black headless dog-fiend, on one
occasion, about the year 1825, suddenly appeared before, or rather
behind, him, not far from the then Collegiate Church; and, placing
its fore paws upon his shoulders, actually ran him home at a rapid
rate, in spite of his strenuous resistance. He was so terrified at the
incident that he rushed into bed in his dirty clothes, much to the
surprise and dismay of his family. This particular dog-boggart is
believed yet by many to have been "laid" and buried under the dry
arch of the old bridge across the Irwell, on the Salford side of the
river; and that the spell to which it has been subjected will endure
for 999 years, which, I suppose, in vulgar as well as legal parlance,
is supposed to be nearly equivalent to the more comprehensive term&mdash;"for
ever."</p>

<p>In Larwood and Hotten's "History of Signboards," I find the
following:&mdash;"This Black Dog may have derived its name from the
canine spectre that still frightens the ignorant and fearful in the rural
districts, just as the terrible Dun Cow and the Lambton Worm were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the terror of the people in olden times. Near Lyme Regis, Dorset,
there is an alehouse which has this black fiend in all his ancient
ugliness painted over the door. Its adoption there arose from a legend
that the spectral black dog used to haunt at nights the kitchen fire of
a neighbouring farm-house, formerly a Royalist mansion, destroyed
by Cromwell's troops. The dog would sit opposite the farmer; but
one night a little extra liquor gave the man additional courage, and
he struck at the dog, intending to rid himself of the horrid thing.
Away, however, flew the dog, and the farmer after him, from one
room to another, until it sprang through the roof, and was seen no
more that night. In mending the hole, a lot of money fell down,
which, of course, was connected in some way or other with the dog's
strange visit. Near the house is a lane still called Dog Lane, which
is now the favourite walk of the black dog, and to this <i>genius loci</i> the
sign is dedicated."</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the "Trash" or "Skriker" described
by Mr. Wilkinson, of Burnley, has some relationship to the strayed
hound of Odin, and more especially so, as the spectre huntsman is
well known in the neighbourhood of the Cliviger gorge. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The appearance of this sprite is considered a certain death-sign,
and has obtained the local names of 'Trash' or 'Skriker.' He
generally appears to one of the family from which death is about to
select his victim, and is more or less visible according to the distance
of the event. I have met with persons to whom the barghaist has
assumed the form of a white cow or a horse; but on most occasions
'Trash' is described as having the appearance of a large dog, with
very broad feet, shaggy hair, drooping ears, and 'eyes as large as
saucers.' When walking, his feet make a loud splashing noise, like
old shoes in a miry road, and hence the name of 'Trash.' The
appellation, 'Skriker,' has reference to the screams uttered by the
sprite, which are frequently heard when the animal is invisible.
When followed by any individual, he begins to walk backwards, with
his eyes fixed full on his pursuer, and vanishes on the slightest
momentary inattention. Occasionally he plunges into a pool of
water, and at other times he sinks at the feet of the person to whom
he appears with a loud splashing noise, as if a heavy stone was thrown
into the miry road. Some are reported to have attempted to strike
him with any weapon they had at hand, but there was no substance
present to receive the blows, although the Skriker kept his ground.
He is said to frequent the neighbourhood of Burnley at present, and
is mostly seen in Godly Lane and about the Parochial Church; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
he by no means confines his visits to the churchyard, as similar
sprites are said to do in other parts of England and Wales."</p>

<p>Grose tells us that dogs have "the faculty of seeing spirits," and
he instances the case of one David Hunter, a neatherd to the Bishop
of Down and Connor, whose dog accompanied him <i>quietly</i>, when, from
an impulse he was unable to restrain, he wandered after the apparition
of an old woman by which he was haunted. "But," Grose adds,
"they usually show signs of terror, by whining and creeping to their
master for protection; and it is generally supposed that they often
see things of this nature when their owner cannot; there being some
persons, particularly those born on a Christmas-eve, who cannot see
spirits."</p>

<p>Max M&uuml;ller etymologically identifies the classic Cerberus or Kerberos
with the Vedic Sarvari, "the dog of night, watching the path
to the lower world." Grimm says that the dog is an embodiment of
the wind and an attendant of the dead both in the mythology of the
Germans and the Aryans, and that both these attributes are conspicuous
in the wild hunt superstitions. Dogs, he adds, see ghosts, as well
as the goddess of death, Hel, although she is invisible to human
eyes. Kuhn contends that the name of Yama's canine messengers,
S&acirc;rameyas, was borne in Greek form, by the messenger of the Greek
gods, Hermeias or Hermes, the conductor of the shades of the departed
to the realm of Hades. With the aid of Athen&ecirc;, Hermes conducted
Heracles in safety, with the dog Kerberos, out of Hades.</p>

<p>In the "Merry Devil of Edmonton" (1631) is the following reference
to this superstition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know thee well; I heare the watchfull dogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hollow howling, tell of thy approach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lights burne dim, affrighted with thy presence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this distempered and tempestuous night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tells me the ayre is troubled with some devill.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The superstition that the howling of a dog, especially in the night
time, portends the death of some person in the immediate neighbourhood,
is yet, at the present day, firmly believed in, even by the
middle, and by no means uneducated, classes in Lancashire. I
listened, not very long ago, to the serious recital of a story by one
who heard the howling and knew well the party whose death immediately
followed. He himself, being sick at the time, deemed his own
end approaching, but was relieved of his terror on being informed
that a well-known neighbour had just expired.</p>

<p>It is by no means improbable that the extremely delicate sense of
smell possessed by some of the canine species or varieties, as especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
exhibited in the scenting of game and carrion or putrid flesh,
may have influenced the original personification of the dog as an
attendant on the dead.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens, in a recent Christmas story, describes, with
his usual felicity, a rather singular phase of this "howling hound"
superstition. It appears that Dr. Marigold's dog, true to the instincts
of his blustering race, could snuff an approaching storm of a "domestic"
character with the most unerring precision. Certainly there are
localities in which the blasts of old Boreas, and the storm songs of
the Maruts, are infinitely more disagreeable than they are in certain
others. To encounter them alone on the bleak mountain top, or in a
wild gorge, like that of Cliviger, on an "old-fashioned Christmas"
or New Year's-eve, is not productive of exactly the same kind of
satisfaction as results from attentively listening to their wild harmonies
when seated in a warm corner of one's own "snuggery," with
plenty of good cheer, and a select few of tried old friends partaking
of the hospitality characteristic of the season. Dr. Marigold, who is
neither more nor less than the witty and loquacious "Cheap John,"
of mock-auction renown, thinks, very properly, that his peripatetic
place of business was a very unsuitable locality for domestic hurricanes.
He says:&mdash;"We might have had such a pleasant life. A
roomy cart, with the large goods hung outside, and the bed slung
underneath it when on the road, an iron pot and kettle, a fire-place
for the cold weather, a chimney for the smoke, a hanging-shelf and a
cupboard, a dog, and a horse. What more do you want? You draw
off on a bit of turf in a green lane or by the roadside, you hobble your
old horse and turn him grazing, you light your fire upon the ashes of
the last visitors', you cook your stew, and you would not call the
Emperor of France your father. But have a <i>temper</i> in the cart, flinging
language and the hardest goods in stock at you, and where are
you then? Put a name to your feelings! My dog knew as well
when she was on the turn as I did. Before she broke out, he would
give a howl, and bolt. How he knew it was a mystery to me, but the
sure and certain knowledge of it would wake him up out of his soundest
sleep, and he would give a howl and bolt. At such times I wished
I was him."</p>

<p>The large "saucer eyes" of Skriker, and his "<i>vanishing</i> on the
slightest momentary inattention," are suggestive of some connection
with lightning or the ignis fatuus, or wild fire; and, singularly enough,
I find Will-o'-whisp traditions bear considerable resemblance to those
which appertain to the furious host. Mr. Thoms, in his "Shakspere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Notelets," has some curious information on this subject. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"According to some these phantoms are believed to be the souls
of children who have died unbaptised; while others again believe
them to be the restless spirits of wicked and covetous men, who have
not scrupled, for the sake of their own aggrandisement, to remove
their neighbours' landmarks. In Brittany, we learn from Villemarqu&eacute;,
the <i>Porte-brandon</i> appears in the form of a child bearing a
torch, which he turns like a burning wheel; and with this it is said
he sets fire to the villages, which are sometimes suddenly in the
middle of the night wrapped in flames. In Lusatia, where these
wandering children are also supposed to be the souls of unbaptised
children, they are believed to be perfectly harmless, and to be relieved
from their destined wanderings as soon as any pious hand throws a
handful of consecrated ground after them."</p>

<p>This form of superstition prevails yet to a considerable extent in
the north of England and Scotland.</p>

<p>The Maruts or storm-winds of the Sanscrit myths, who rode on
tawny-coloured horses, roared like lions, shook the mountains, and
tore up trees, when their wild work was done, Max M&uuml;ller informs
us, assumed again, "according to their wont, the form of new-born
babes," a phrase which, as Mr. Cox justly observes, "exhibits the
germ, and more than the germ, of the myth of Hermes returning like
a child to his cradle after tearing up the forests." Hermes, as a personification
of both the gentle breeze and the stormy wind, gives forth
soothing as well as martial music, and his plaintive breath was supposed
"to waft the spirits of the dead to their unseen home." Crantz
says the Greenland Esquimaux "lay a dog's head by the grave of a
child, for the soul of a dog can find its way everywhere, and will show
the ignorant babe the way to the land of souls." The Parsees place
a dog before the dying, from a similar superstitious belief.</p>

<p>There is much probability in the suggestion that Shakspere had
some of these superstitions in view when he placed in the mouth of
Macbeth, while contemplating the murder, and its consequences, of
the "gracious Duncan," the following magnificent metaphors:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Pity, like a naked new-born babe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striding the blast, or Heaven's cherubim, horsed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the sightless couriers of the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tears shall drown the wind!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The furious host, in the German versions, is sometimes "a cavalcade
of the dead," and not exactly a wild hunt, in the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
acceptation of the term. Kelly says:&mdash;"Sometimes it gallops through
the stormy air as a herd of wild boars; but the spirits of which it
consists generally appear in human form. They are of both sexes
and of all ages, souls of unchristened babes being included among
them; for Holda or Bertha often joins the hunt." When Odin rides
at the head of a full field, he is believed to chase a horse or a wild
boar; but when he alone appears at the heels of his yelping pack, it
"is in pursuit of a woman with long snow-white breasts. Seven
years he follows her; at last he runs her down, throws her across his
horse, and carries her home." These seven years are regarded by commentators
as having reference to the seven winter months of the year,
during which "the spell bound" lightning and storm-god was unable,
owing to the prevailing cold weather, to continue in active chase of his
flying bride. This latter myth concerning the chased maiden seems
to be the counterpart or prototype of the spectre huntsman, who "is
believed to pursue a milk-white doe round the Eagle's Crag, in the
Vale of Todmorden, on All-Hallow Eve," as related by Mr. Wilkinson.
In Germany the wild hunt chases a whole flock of elfish beings, the
moss-wifekins and wood-maidens, whose lives are bound up with those
of the forest trees. Holda and Bertha are but local or characteristic
appellations for the goddess Freyja (whence our Friday), the wife of
Odin. In some parts of Germany the wild hunt is called the dead
hunt (Heljagd), and, in others, the English hunt (<i>die Engelske jagd</i>),
which are synonymous, England being but, at one period, "another
name for the nether world." Hel or Hela, was the name of both the
Scandinavian and German goddess of death. Kuhn, referring to the
dispute whether the ancient locality of departed souls was Great
Britain or Brittany, decides in favour of the former, and informs us
that the German peasants to this day use such expressions as the
following: "How the bells are ringing in England!" "How my
children are crying in England!" when referring to the nether or
lower regions.</p>

<p>The dismal realm of Hela, which was a journey of nine days' dreary
descent from Heaven, was termed Niflheimr, the world of mists. It
was said to be situated under one of the roots of the great world-tree,
Yggdrasil, but it appears not to have been regarded, like the modern
Hell, as a place of torment or punishment for sins committed on earth.
It seems to have had more relationship to the Greek Hades. All departed
souls, good and evil, dwelt in Hela's realm, with the exception
of those of heroes slain in battle, which were conveyed at once to Valhalla,
by Odin himself. Kelly says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"But the idea of retribution after death for crimes done in the body
was not unknown to German paganism. It was part of the Aryan
creed, and the Vedas speak of the goddess Nirriti, and her dreadful
world Naraka, the destined abode of all guilty souls. It is not conceivable
that such a tradition could have died out, even for a time,
amongst any of the pagan Indo-Europeans."</p>

<p>In support of his position, Kelly cites the following passage from
Kemble's "Saxons in England":&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the perjurer and the secret murderer Nastrond existed, a
place of torment and punishment&mdash;the strand of the dead&mdash;filled with
foulness, peopled with poisonous serpents, dark, cold, and gloomy;
the kingdom of Hel was <i>Hades</i>, the invisible, the world of shadows;
Nastrond was what we call Hell."</p>

<p>Kelly further contends that as "the heaven of the (Aryan) Pitris is
often called 'the world of good deed, the world of the righteous,' and
as they themselves were spirits of light and ministers of all good men,
there is strong reason for inferring, although the fact is nowhere
expressly stated, that the inhabitants of the opposite world became
spirits of darkness, and confederates of all the evil powers." He
adds,&mdash;"If this conjecture prove to be well founded, it will have
brought to light another remarkable instance of the continuity of
Aryan tradition."</p>

<p>The Rev. G. W. Cox, however, scarcely indorses this view of the
Gothic Hell and Devil. He says,&mdash;"Hel had been like Persephon&ecirc;,
the queen of the unseen land,&mdash;in the ideas of the northern tribes, a
land of bitter cold and icy walls. She now became not the queen of
Niflheim, but Niflheim itself, while her abode, though gloomy enough,
was not wholly destitute of material comforts. It became the Hell
where the old man hews wood for the Christmas fire, and where the
Devil in his eagerness to buy the flitch of bacon yields up the marvellous
quern which is 'good to grind almost anything.' It was not
so pleasant, indeed, as Heaven, or the old Valhalla, but it was better
to be there than shut out in the outer cold beyond its padlocked gates.
But more particularly the Devil was a being who under pressure of
hunger might be drawn into acting against his own interest, in other
words he might be outwitted, and this character of a poor or stupid
devil is almost the only one exhibited in Teutonic legends. In fact,
as Professor Max M&uuml;ller remarks, the Germans, when they had been
'indoctrinated with the idea of a real devil, the Semitic Satan or
Diabolus, treated him in the most good-humoured manner;' nor is it
easy to resist Dr. Dasent's conclusion that 'no greater proof can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
given of the small hold which the Christian Devil has taken of the
Norse mind than the heathen aspect under which he constantly
appears, and the ludicrous way in which he is always outwitted.'"
Mr. Cox adds, in a note, that it has "been said of Southey that he
could never think of the devil without laughing. This is but saying
that he had the genuine humour of our Teutonic ancestors."</p>

<p>Dasent, in his "Popular Tales from the Norse," says,&mdash;"The
Christian notion of Hell is that of a place of heat, for in the East,
whence Christianity came, heat is often an intolerable torment, and
cold, on the other hand, everything that is pleasant and delightful.
But to the dwellers in the North heat brings with it sensations of joy
and comfort, and life without fire has a dreary outlook; so their Hel
ruled in a cold region over those who were cowards by implication,
while the mead-cup went round and huge logs blazed and crackled in
Valhalla for the brave and beautiful who had dared to die on the field
of battle. But under Christianity the extremes of heat and cold have
met, and Hel, the cold, uncomfortable goddess, is now our Hell, where
flames and fires abound, and where the devils abide in everlasting
flame."</p>

<p>How grandly has Shakspere expressed the various traditionary
forms respecting the lost soul's lodgment or condition after death,
in "Measure for Measure." In act 3, scene 1, Claudio exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ay, but to die and go we know not where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blown with restless violence round about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pendent world; or to be worse than worst<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wearied and most loathed worldly life,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Can lay on nature, is a paradise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what we fear of death.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a common superstition yet that the ghosts of persons,
murdered or otherwise, not buried in consecrated ground, cannot rest,
but must wander about in search of the means of Christian sepulture.
This superstition obtained amongst the Greeks and Latins. The
ghosts of unburied bodies, not possessing the <i>obolus</i> or fee due to
Charon, the ferryman of the <i>Styx</i> or <i>Acheron</i>, were unable to obtain a
lodging or place of rest. They were, therefore, compelled to wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
about the banks of the river for a hundred years, when the <i>Portitor</i> or
"ferryman of hell" passed them over, <i>in forma pauperis</i>. Hence the
sacred nature of the duty of surviving relatives and friends under
the most trying circumstances. The celebrated tragedy of Antigone,
by Sophocles, owes its chief interest and pathos to the popular faith
on this subject.</p>

<p>Brand on the authority of Aubrey, states that, amongst the vulgar
in Yorkshire, it was believed, "and, perhaps, is in part still," that,
after a person's death, the soul went over Whinney Moor; and till
about 1624, at the funeral, a woman came (like a Pr&aelig;fica) and sung
the following song:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the "Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border," this song is printed
with one or two slight variations, with the title of a "Lyke-Wake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Dirge." Sir Walter Scott likewise quotes a passage from a MS.
in the Cotton Library, descriptive of Cleveland in the northern part
of Yorkshire, in Elizabeth's reign, which aptly illustrates this custom.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When any dieth certaine women sing a song to the dead bodie,
reciting the journey that the partye deceased must goe, and they are
of beliefe (such is their fondnesse) that once in their lives it is good
to give a pair of new shoes to a poor man, for as much as after this life
they are to pass barefoote through a great launde, full of thorns and
furzen, except by the meryte of the almes aforesaid they have redemed
the forfeyte; for at the edge of the launde an olde man shall meet
them with the same shoes that were given by the partie when he was
lyving, and after he had shodde them, dismisseth them to go through
thick and thin without scratch or scalle."</p>

<p>According to Mannhardt and Grimm a pair of shoes was deposited
in the grave, in Scandinavia and Germany, for this very purpose. In
the Henneberg district, on this account, the name <i>todtenschuh</i>, or
"dead shoe" is applied to a funeral. In Scandinavia the shoe is
named <i>helsk&ouml;</i> or "hel-shoe."</p>

<p>It is customary yet in some parts of the North of England to place
a plate filled with salt on the stomach of a corpse soon after death.
Lighted candles too, are sometimes placed on or about the body.
Reginald Scot says, in his "Discourse concerning Devils and Spirits,"
on the authority of Bodin, that "the devil loveth no salt in his meat,
for that is a sign of eternity, and used by God's commandment in all
sacrifices." Douce, speaking of this practice, particularly in Leicestershire,
says it is done with the view of preventing air from getting into
the bowels and swelling the body. Herrick, in his "Hesperides,"
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The Soul is the Salt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The body's salt the soul is, which, when gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flesh soon sucks in putrifaction.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>According to the learned Moresin the devil abhorreth salt, it being
the emblem of eternity and immortality. It is not liable to corruption
itself, and it preserves other substances from decay. Hence
its superstitious or emblematical import.</p>

<p>The screaming of certain birds, as we have already seen, foreboded
disaster. In some districts the midnight flight of flocks of migratory
seafowl are believed to be the cause of the noises in the atmosphere,
which the peasant's imagination translates into the rush of the
furious host. Mr. Yarrell, in "Notes and Queries," says that flocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of bean-geese, from Scandinavia and Scotland, when flying over
various parts of England, select very dark nights for their migrations,
and that their flight is accompanied by a very loud and very
peculiar cry. The "seven whistlers," referred to by Wordsworth,
and others already quoted, in some instances appear to be curlews,
whose screams are believed by fishermen to announce the approach
of a tempest.</p>

<p>The bellowing of cows at unseasonable hours was likewise regarded
as an announcement of death, as well as the howling of the dog. Cows
in the Aryan mythology represented the rain clouds. Odin and his host,
nevertheless, seem to have fancied the earthly article. They were
said to carry cows away, milk them dry, and, in about three days,
generally return them, but not always. It was idle for the farmer to
refuse complying, as when the furious host appeared, the fattest
animals in the stalls became restive, and on being let loose suddenly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The Lancashire peasant, in some districts, still believes the "Milky
Way" to be the path by which departed souls enter Heaven. Mr.
Benjamin Brierley, in one of his Lancashire stories, places in the
mouth of one of his strongly marked provincial characters, the following
expression,&mdash;"When tha goes up th' cow lone (lane) to th' better
place," and he assures me that he has often heard the expression from
the lips of the peasantry. The Germans entertain a similar belief in
the "Milky Way" being the spirit path to heaven. In Friesland its
name is <i>kaupat</i>, or cowpath. The giving of a cow to the poor, while
on earth, was considered to confer upon the donor the power to pass
with certainty the fearful Gjallar bridge; for, as in the Vedic superstition,
a cow, (or cloud,) would be present to aid his soul to make the
passage in safety. Mannhardt informs us that "hence it was of yore
a funeral custom in Sweden, Denmark, England, Upper and Lower
Germany, that a cow should follow the coffin to the churchyard. This
custom was partially continued until recent times, being accounted
for on the ground that the cow was a gift to the clergy for saying
masses for the dead man's soul or preaching his funeral sermon."</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the "mortuary" or "heriot" of the
olden time, which rendered the gift of a cow to the church, on the
death of a parishioner, as a condonement of possibly unpaid dues, a
necessary condition of clerical favour, was based on some such superstition.
It was customary, in some places, to drive the cow in the
procession of the funeral <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> to the place of sepulture. Mr. E.
Baines, speaking of the manor of Ashton-under-Lyne, says:&mdash;"The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
obnoxious feudal <i>heriot</i>, consisting of the best beast on the farm,
required to be given to the lord, on the death of the farmer, was a
cruel and unmanly exaction, in illustration of which there are many
traditionary stories in the manor of Ashton, and no doubt in other
manors. The priest, as well as the lord of the manor, claimed his
heriot, called a mortuary in these early times, on the death of his
parishioners, as a kind of expiation for the personal tithes, which the
deceased in his lifetime had neglected to pay." He adds that the
custom was in Ashton for "<i>holy kirk</i>" to take the <i>best</i> beast, and the
lord of the manor the <i>second</i> best.</p>

<p>To those who treated Odin with proper respect when he and his
hunters passed by, he is said to have dropped a horse's leg or haunch,
which turned to gold. Those who mocked him received a similar
present, or "moss-wifekin's foot, with the green shoe upon it." But
the limb in the latter case became f&#339;tid, and the horrible stench
resulting therefrom defied all attempts to remove it.</p>

<p>All of these legends have been resolved into figurative and sometimes
highly poetic descriptions of natural phenomena, and especially what
is termed the "elemental strife." The horse's leg thrown down by
Odin represents the crooked lightning's flash; the gold its brightness,
and the stench its sulphurous odour. The wild boars which he hunts
are stormy wind-clouds; the fair ladies the light white scudding
vapours that seem to coquette with the squally wind. Odin's broad-brimmed
hat is the dark cloud, and his mantle the starry heavens.
Kelly says&mdash;"The moss-wifekins and wood-maidens are female elementary
spirits brought down to the earth from the clouds to become
genii of the forest, and when they are chased <i>in whole flocks</i>&mdash;or, in
other words, when the leaves are blown off the trees&mdash;this is but a
modification of the older conception of flying clouds.... The wild
huntsman loves to ride through houses that have two outer doors
directly opposite to each other; that is to say, in plain prose, a
thorough draft, more or less strong, from one door to the other."</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin, in his recent lectures at Oxford, as "Slade Professor of
Fine Art," gives an admirable example from paintings on an ancient
vase, of the manner in which Greek artistic genius gradually evolved
from out of natural phenomena, their mythological personifications.
He says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"First you have Apollo ascending from the sea; thought of as the
<i>physical sunrise</i>: only a circle of light for his head; his chariot horses
seen foreshortened, black against the day-break, their feet not yet
risen above the horizon. Underneath is the painting from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
opposite side of the same vase: Athena as the morning breeze, and
Hermes as the morning cloud, flying across the waves before sunrise.
At the distance I now hold them from you, it is scarcely possible for
you to see that they are figures at all, so like are they to broken fragments
of flying mist; and when you look close you will see that as
Apollo's face is invisible in the circle of light, Mercury's is invisible in
the broken form of cloud; but I can tell you that it is conceived as
reverted, looking back to Athena; the grotesque appearance of feature
in the front is the outline of his hair. These two paintings are
exceedingly rude, and of the arch&aelig;ic period; the deities being yet
thought of chiefly as physical powers in violent agency."</p>

<p>Max M&uuml;ller contends that the earlier Aryan name for the Ribhus,
namely Arbhus, is identical with the Greek Orpheus. Philologists,
by the aid of the earlier Sanscrit writings, have been enabled to get
at the roots of many Greek names, which formerly defied investigation.
We see in the musical influence of Orpheus over trees, rocks,
and mountain torrents, but a highly artistic development of the
original Aryan storm-wind myth. By certain well understood philological
steps, the term Arbhus has passed, in its Teutonic descent,
into Albs, Alb, or Alp, which in the plural yields Elbe and Elfen, the
equivalents of our English Elf and Elves.</p>

<p>Another remnant of the Aryan nomenclature of the train of Odin,
the wild huntsman, may be found in the word m&acirc;rt or maur, as
presented in the English word nightmare, and the French couchemar,
which are evidently descended from the Maruts or wind-gods of the
Vedas. The nightmare is known to result chiefly from that form of
dyspepsia termed flatulent. The corruption of the word in English
to mare has given rise to some singular blunders, and none greater
or more absurd than that perpetrated by Fuseli, the Royal Academician,
in his celebrated picture of "The Nightmare," in which he
represents the fiend in equine form bestraddling his unhappy victim.
Kelly says he can find accounts of the nightmare assuming the forms
of a mouse, a weasel, a toad, and even a cat, but never that of a
horse or a mare, except in the picture referred to. The fact is, the
genuine nightmare is the rider who plies his spurs and grips the
reins, and not a mare that has usurped the function of a jockey.
Aubrey, in his "Miscellanies," describes one phase of the superstition
as a remnant of witchcraft. "To hinder the nightmare, they
hang in a string a flint with a hole in it. It is to prevent the nightmare,
viz., the hag, from riding their horses, who will sometimes
sweat at night. The flint thus hung does hinder it." Brand observes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that "ephialtes, or nightmare, is called by common people
<i>witch-riding</i>." He traces the superstition to the Gothic or Scandinavian
Mara, "a spectre of the night."</p>

<p>In classical mythology Pan was regarded as the author of sudden
frights or groundless alarms. Dr. Adam, in his "Roman Antiquities,"
says that Faunus and Sylvanus were "supposed to be the same with
Pan." He further adds,&mdash;"There were several rural deities called
Fauni, who were believed to occasion the nightmare."</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the modern equine form of the hag
may have resulted from ordinary punning. Lluellin (1679) has the
following stanza, which refers to the power of coral over the nightmare.
Hence the prejudice in favour of coral beads for children
which obtains to this day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Some the night-mare hath prest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With that weight on their breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No returnes of their breath can passe.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But to us the tale is addle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We can take off her saddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn out the night-mare to grasse.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Another old writer, Holiday, in his "Marriage of the Arts," deprecates
the practice of relying on charms, "that your stables may bee
alwies free from the queene of the goblins." He, however, makes
the night-hag equestrian or jockey, and not equine. Herrick, too,
in his "Hesperides," is both correct and explicit on the subject.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hang up hooks and shears to scare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence the hag that rides the mare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they be all over wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the mire and the sweat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This observed, the manes shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your horses all knot free.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The term "nightmare," in some instances, may have been applied
to a witch transformed into a mare by means of a magic bridle, and
ridden with great violence by the very party at whose bedside she
had previously metamorphosed into a steed, on the back of which
she had galloped to the witches' revel. If the man-horse contrived
to slip off the bridle, and throw it over the witch's head, she immediately
became transformed into a mare, and was frequently,
according to popular belief, subjected to much harsh usage. There
appears, however, to be little doubt that the night-mares are legitimately
descended from the Aryan Maruts, the "couriers of the air,"
who rode the winds in the "wild hunt," or "furious host," headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
by Odin, or the renowned spectre horseman of medi&aelig;val legends.
Kelly says, "these riders, in all other respects identical with the
Maruts, are in some parts of Germany called Wabriderske, <i>i.e.</i>,
Valkyrs. In some of the tales that are told of them they still
retain their old divine nature; in others they are brought down to
the level of mere earthly witches. If they ride now in stables,
without locomotion, it is because they swept of old through the air
on their divine coursers. Now they steal by night to the beds of
hinds and churls; but there was a time when they descended from
Valhalla to conceive, in the embrace of a mortal, the demi-god whom
they afterwards accompanied to the battle-field, to bear him thence
to the hall of Odin."</p>

<p>I entertain a strong impression that the singular ceremony practised
at Ashton-under-Lyne, at Easter, styled "<i>Riding the Black Lad</i>,"
contains some remnant of the tradition of the spectre huntsman. Its
origin is confessed on all hands to be extremely doubtful. The
severities of a Sir Ralph Assheton, in the reign of Henry VI., may have
had something to do with it, but they alone could scarcely have perpetuated
the legend and its accessories. The custom of perambulating
the parish boundaries, still in use in many parts of England, and
which, in my own youth, was performed with much solemnity by the
Corporation of Preston, may likewise have had some influence upon
the practice. At the close of the Preston perambulation, it was
customary for the younger spirits "to leap the colt-hole," as it was
termed, the said "colt-hole" being a ditch or fosse on Preston Marsh.
Some unlucky wights occasionally fell into the said ditch, to the
infinite amusement of the graver dignitaries, as well as to the merriment
of the holiday schoolboys attendant. Dr. Hibbert Ware,
referring to the Ashton custom, says:&mdash;"An effigy is made of a man
in armour, and the image is deridingly emblazoned with some emblems
of the occupation of the first couple that are linked together in the
course of the year." The story of the enforcing of the weeding of
"Carr gulds" (an obnoxious plant) from the land by Sir Ralph's
rough riding, may have had some foundation in fact; but it is rather
strange a successor should have "abolished the usage for ever, and
reserved from the estate a small sum of money, for the purpose of
perpetuating, in an annual ceremony, the memory of the dreaded
visits of the Black Knight."</p>

<p>Spelman, in his "Icenia," referring to the Tilney legend concerning
Tom Hickathrift and his giant-slaying, clearly shows that the
"monstrous giant," slain by Tom, armed with his axle and wheel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
like the Cornish Tom the Tinkheard, and his followers, was none
other than the tyrant lord of the manor who sought by violence to
rob his copy-hold tenants out of their right of pasture in the common
field.</p>

<p>Samuel Bamford, in his poem of the "Wild Rider," relates a legend
not uncommon in various parts of the country, about a Sir Ashton
Lever, a lover of a descendant of the Black Knight, who seems to
have rivalled him in horsemanship. Bamford, in a note, says:&mdash;"He
was an excellent bowman and a fearless rider, and tradition has
handed down stories of feats of horsemanship analogous to those
recited in the ballad, accompanied with sage intimations that <i>no horse
could have carried him save one of more than earthly breed or human training</i>."
The narrow valley of the Tame, in the neighbourhood of
Ashton, is as likely as the gorge at Cliviger to be haunted by the
storm-rider or the wild hunt. Singularly enough, Mr. Baines, in his
History of Lancashire, relates minutely the particulars of two tremendous
storms which devastated the locality, one in 1817, and the
other 26 years previously. They both created much dismay, and the
latter, he says, caused "an involuntary expression of horror throughout
the whole place." A neighbouring exposed hill is named the
"Wild Bank." Around it storms often rage with great fury. In one
of the Welsh triads, we find that the "three embellishing names of
the wind" are "Hero of the World, Architect of Bad Weather, and
Assaulter of the Hills." It has been previously shown the spectre
huntsman of Dartmoor is styled the "<i>Black</i> Master," which lends
further probability to the hypothesis advanced.</p>

<p>Since the bulk of the preceding pages in this chapter were written,
I obtained a copy of Mr. R. Hunt's recently published work, entitled
"Popular Romances of the West of England; or the Drolls, Traditions,
and Superstitions of Old Cornwall." In it I find several curious
and highly interesting variations of the legend or myth of the spectre
huntsman, or the furious host, which exhibit not only the connection
of the Wandering Jew tradition with that of the hunt of Odin and his
followers, but which I conceive throw much light upon, and, to a large
extent, countenance the hypothesis I have submitted, that the legend
of the celebrated black knight, or "black lad," of Ashton-under-Lyne,
retains, along with more modern additions, something of the original
Aryan personification of the "elemental strife" previously described.
Speaking of the "demon Tregeagle," a well-known legendary hero
of "Old Cornwall," he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who has not heard of the wild spirit of Tregeagle? He haunts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
equally the moor, the rocky coasts, and the blown sandhills of Cornwall.
From north to south, from east to west, this doomed spirit is
heard of, <i>and to the day of judgment he is doomed to wander</i>, pursued by
avenging fiends. For ever endeavouring to perform some task by
which he hopes to secure repose, and being for ever defeated. Who
has not heard of the <i>howling</i> of Tregeagle? When the storms come
with all their strength from the Atlantic, and urge themselves upon
the rocks around Land's End, <i>the howls of the spirit are louder than the
roaring of the winds</i>. When calms rest upon the ocean, and the waves
can scarcely form upon the resting waters, <i>low wailings creep along the
coast. These are the wailings of this wandering soul.</i> When midnight is
on the Moor or on the mountains, and the night winds whistle amidst
the rugged cairns, <i>the shrieks of</i> Tregeagle are distinctly heard. We
know that he is <i>pursued by the demon dogs</i>, and that till day-break he
must fly with all speed before them. The voice of Tregeagle is everywhere,
and yet he is unseen by human eye. Every reader will at
once perceive that Tregeagle <i>belongs to the mythologies of the oldest
nations</i>, and that <i>the traditions of this wandering spirit</i> in Cornwall,
<i>which centre upon</i> <span class="smcapl">ONE TYRANNICAL MAGISTRATE</span>, <i>are but the appropriation
of stories which belong to every age and country</i>."</p>

<p>Here we have clearly a combination of the doings of the Teutonic
spectre huntsman, Odin, and of his prototypes the Aryan storm-gods,
Indra and Rudra, and their attendant Maruts and the Ribhus; the
wailings of the homeless souls of the Irish and other legends; the
interminable toil of the Wandering Jew; and the more modern tradition
of the hard-hearted lord of the soil, whose deeds have rendered
his name odious to the commonalty. The latter worthy modern tradition
asserts, as in the case of the Ashton "Black Knight," to have
been a relatively recent <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> "tyrannical magistrate," and a
"rapacious and unscrupulous landlord," and "one of the Tregeagles
who once owned Trevorder near Bodmin." At his death the fiends
were anxious to get immediate possession of the soul of this "gigantic
sinner;" but the hardened murderer, terrified at his fate, "gave to
the priesthood wealth, that they might fight with them, and save
his soul from eternal fire." On one occasion it is said that his
wandering spirit actually gave evidence in a court of justice, when
the fiends in vain endeavoured to carry him off. The power of the
priesthood prevailed, but only with the condition attached that the
wretched sinner should undertake "some task difficult beyond the
power of human nature, which might be extended far into eternity,"
with the view that the power of repentance might gradually exert its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
ameliorating influence. His only hope for ultimate salvation was
perpetual toil. The demons could not molest him so long as he continued
his labour.</p>

<p>The first labour to which he was subjected was the emptying of
Dosmery Pool, a mountain lake, some miles in circumference. This,
in itself no slight task, was believed to be rendered more difficult
from the supposed fact that the said pool was bottomless, inasmuch
as tradition asserted that "once on a time" a thorn bush which had
been sunk near its centre had reappeared in Falmouth harbour.
One churchman, it is said, nevertheless thought the plan not sufficiently
hopeless. He therefore suggested that the only lading or
baling utensil employed by the miserable sinner should be a limpet
shell with a sufficiently large hole in it to seriously augment the
necessary labour. The demon kept his eye on Tregeagle, and endeavoured
to divert his attention from his toil, in order that he might
lay hold of him. But although he <i>raised many tempests</i>, still the
doomed one continued to labour. On one occasion, however, the
fiends were nearly "too many" for the eternal toiler. Mr. Hunt's
description of this terrible struggle is so strikingly suggestive of one
of the myths to which I have referred its origin, that I give it entire.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nature was at war with herself, the elements had lost their
balance, and there was a terrific struggle to recover it. Lightnings
flashed and coiled like fiery snakes around the rocks of Roughtor.
Fire-balls fell on the desert moors and hissed in the accursed lake.
Thunders pealed through the heavens, and echoed from hill to hill;
an earthquake shook the solid earth, and terror was on all living.
The winds rose and raged with a fury which was irresistible, and
hail beat so mercilessly on all things that it spread death around.
Long did Tregeagle stand the 'pelting of the pitiless storm,' but at
length he yielded to its force and fled. The demons in crowds were at his
heels. He doubled, however, on his pursuers and returned to the lake;
but so rapid were they that he could not rest the required moment
to dip his shell in the now seething waters. Three times he fled
round the lake, and the evil ones pursued him. Then feeling that
there was no safety for him near Dosmery Pool, he sprang swifter
than the wind across it, shrieking with agony, and thus&mdash;since the
devils cannot cross water, and were obliged to go round the lake&mdash;he
gained on them and fled over the moor. Away, away went Tregeagle,
faster and faster, the dark spirits pursuing, and they had
nearly overtaken him, when he saw Roach Rock and its chapel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
before him. He rushed up the rocks, with giant power clambered to
the eastern window, and dashed his head through it, thus securing
the shelter of its sanctity. The defeated demons retired, and long
and loud were their wild wailings in the air. The inhabitants of the
moors and of the neighbouring towns slept not a wink that night."</p>

<p>This "wild hunt" is, in some respects, suggestive of Tam
O'Shanter's narrow escape from the devil and the witches at
Alloway Kirk.</p>

<p>In his "Address to the Deil," Burns associates both the devil and
witches with stormy weather. He says, of the former:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whyles raging like a roaring lion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For prey a' holes an' corners tryin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whyles on the strong-wing'd tempest flyin';<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Tirlin the kirks.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let warlocks grim, and wither'd hags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell how wi' you, on ragweed nags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They skim the moors an' dizzy crags,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Wi' wicked speed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">But this is rather corroborative than otherwise of the hypothesis of
their common origin. I have previously shown that witches were descended
from the Aryan storm-gods or their attendants. Shakspere
appears to have been fully cognisant of their elemental origin, or, in
other words, of their supposed power over "the elements," for he
makes Macbeth, in his extremity, exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I conjure you, by that which you profess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Howe'er you came to know it), answer me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you untie the winds, and let them fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the churches: though the yesty waves<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To what I ask you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tradition that Dosmery Pool was bottomless, reminds me of a
similar presumed phenomenon in the neighbourhood of Preston, which
I have often heard referred to in my youth with implicit faith. It
was confidently asserted that a large pit near the footpath leading
from Moor Park to Cadley Mill was of the bottomless class. Doubtless
it was, at that time, a very deep pit, though I believe now it is
nearly if not entirely dry in the summer season. There was likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a pit on Preston Moor which was supposed to be bottomless. A
similar belief once obtained respecting the "Stone Delph," from
which the material was quarried for the tower of the Parish Church,
Preston, taken down in 1814. I can yet well remember being convinced
of the absurdity of this legend by an older companion, a
good swimmer and diver, bringing up some mud and a stone from the
bottom. The stone delph referred to is situated in the present bed
of the Ribble, at the foot of the steep brow in Avenham Park. The
sinking of water into the caverns of limestone rocks, as in Derbyshire,
and at Malham Cove, in Yorkshire, and other places, may
have originated the notion of "bottomless pits;" but I am inclined
to think that demonology has, likewise, had something to do with
these legends.</p>

<p>The mother of the mythic monster Grendel, in the ancient Anglo-Saxon
poem, Beowulf, lived in a pool or mere on which fire floated
at night, and the depth of which was so great that the wisest living
person knew not its bottom. This mere is supposed to be the sheet
of water from which Hart-le-pool, in the county of Durham, takes
its name.</p>

<p>Tregeagle was next employed on the shore near Padstow, to make
"trusses of sand and ropes of sand with which to bind them." Of
course, each recurring tide swept away the result of his toil, and,
according to the tradition, "the ravings of the baffled soul were
louder than the roarings of the winter tempest." He was afterwards
removed, by the power of the priesthood, to the estuary of the Loo,
and ordered to carry sand across to Porthleven. A fiend maliciously
tripped him up, and the contents of his huge sack, it is said, furnished
the material of the sandbank which forms the bar that destroyed the
harbour of Ella's Town. Yet we learn that "the sea was raging
with the irritation of a passing storm" at the time of the mishap,
which clearly indicates the origin of the legend. Tregeagle's last
location was at the Land's End, where Mr. Hunt says "he would
find no harbour to destroy and few people to terrify. His task was
to sweep the sands from Porthcurnow Cove round the headland
called Tol-Peden-Penwith, into Nanjisal Cove. Those who know
that rugged headland, with its cubical masses of granite, piled in
Titanic grandeur one upon another, will appreciate the task; and
when to all the difficulties are added the strong sweep of the Atlantic
current,&mdash;that portion of the Gulf Stream which washes our southern
shores,&mdash;it will be evident that the melancholy spirit has, indeed, a
task which must endure to the world's end. Even until to-day is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Tregeagle labouring at his task. In calms his wailing is heard; and
those sounds which some call the 'soughing of the wind,' are known
to be the moanings of Tregeagle; while the coming storms are predicted
by the fearful roarings of this condemned mortal."</p>

<p>It is very certain that we have here a singularly curious variation
of the popular legend of the "Wandering Jew," and the myth of the
"spectre huntsman," or the "furious host." The yelping hounds of
the latter are not wanting to complete the picture, for Mr. Hunt tells
us that "the tradition of the Midnight Hunter and his headless
hounds, <i>always, in Cornwall, associated with Tregeagle</i>, prevails everywhere.
The Abbot's Way, on Dartmoor, an ancient road which
extends into Cornwall, is said to be the favourite coursing ground of
the 'wish or whisked hounds of Dartmoor,' called also the 'yell
hounds.' The valley of the Dewerstone is also the place of their
midnight meetings. Once I was told at Jump, that Sir Francis Drake
drove a hearse into Plymouth at night with headless horses, and that
he was followed by a pack of 'yelling hounds' without heads. If dogs
hear the cry of the wish hounds they all die."</p>

<p>The performance attributed to Sir Francis Drake is unquestionably
a relatively modernised version of the mythical black coach story previously
referred to as one form of the furious host legend. The effect
of the cry of the wish hounds on the canine race in Cornwall is similar
to that attributed to their compeers in Lancashire, only the death
resultant is always that of a human being in the northern locality.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt seems to doubt Mr. Kemble's etymology of the term
"wish," when he says:&mdash;"In Devonshire, to this day, all magical or
supernatural dealings go under the common name of wishtness. Can
this have any reference to Woden's name 'Wyse?'" Mr. Hunt, however,
acknowledges that "Mr. Kemble's idea is supported by the fact
that 'there are <i>Wishanger</i> (Wisehanger, or Woden's Meadow,) one about
four miles south-west of Wanborough, in Surrey, and another near
Gloucester.'" He acknowledges, likewise, on the authority of Jabez
Allies, that there is a <i>Wishmoor</i>, which may have such an origin, in
Ledstone, Delamere, Worcestershire. Mr. Hunt thinks that the
word "wish" is intimately "connected with the west country word
'whist,' meaning more than ordinary melancholy, a sorrow which has
something weird about it." Polwhele, in his "Wishful Swain of
Devon," says it is "an expression used by the vulgar to express
local melancholy;" and he adds,&mdash;"There is something sublime in
this impersonation of <i>wishness</i>." It is not at all improbable that both
these etymologies point to a common origin. The deeds of the spectre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
huntsman and the furious host, a "cavalcade of the dead," are not
calculated to impress on the human imagination anything repugnant
to the "melancholy sorrow with something weird surrounding it," to
which Mr. Hunt refers.</p>

<p>This supposed sympathy of "the elements" with human joy, or
sorrow, or suffering, is evidently a very ancient superstition. In
Lancashire we have yet the saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy is the bride that the sun shines on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy is the corpse that the rain rains on.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Shakspere has beautifully illustrated this presumed sensitiveness, not
only of "the elements," but of animated nature, to the perpetration
of deeds of darkness and blood by perverted humanity, in the following
lines, which he places in the mouth of Lennox, on the morning
after the murder of Duncan, by his host, Macbeth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The night has been unruly; where we lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lamentings heard i'the air; strange screams of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prophesying, with accents terrible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dire combustion and confused events,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="noin">The sentiment is still further illustrated, with singular felicity, in the
dialogue which follows, between Rosse and an old man:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;"><div class="stanza">

<p>The Ashton "Black Knight" traditions, doubtless, to some extent,
influenced the colouring of Bamford's poem, "The Wild Rider." Mr.
Hunt quotes from a somewhat similar modern ballad, entitled "<i>Tregeagle
or Dozmare Poole; an Anciente Cornish Legend</i>," by John Penwarne,
in which, however, he states the author has taken considerable
liberties with the tradition. Tregeagle is transformed into a kind of
Faust, and the black hunter, whose "dread voyce they hearde in
wynde," is no other than the arch-fiend himself.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They heard hys curste hell houndes runn yelping behynde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hys steede loude on the eare!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Although, in compliance with his contract with the demon, "the
rede bolte of vengeaunce shot forth wyth a glare, and strooke him a
corpse to the grounde,"</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stylle as the traveller pursues hys lone waye<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He hears the Black Hunter pursuing his preye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shrynkes at his bugle's dread blasts.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we find Odin (the spectre huntsman), by successive degrees,
transformed into Sir Tregeagle, with a black knight attendant. The
pair does not inaptly represent the Sir Ashton, of Bamford's poem,
and the "Black Lad" of the Ashton Legend. The term "Th' Owd
Lad" is a common expression in several parts of Lancashire, and
means literally "Old Nick," or the devil.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Both knights were baffled in affairs of the heart, and the doom of
the one resembles that of the other. Bamford concludes his poem
with the following stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 26em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But strangest of all, on that woe-wedding night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A black horse was stabled where erst stood the white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grooms, when they found him, in terror quick fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His breath was hot smoke, and his eyes burning red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He beat down a strong wall of mortar and crag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tore his oak stall as a dog would a rag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no one durst put forth a hand near that steed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a priest had read Ave, and pater, and creed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span><span class="i0">And then he came forth, the strange beautiful thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With speed that could lead a wild eagle on wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raven had never spread plume on the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose lustrous darkness with his might compare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bore the young Ashton&mdash;none else could him ride&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er flood and o'er fell, and o'er quarry pit wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The housewife, she blest her, and held fast her child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the men swore both horse and his rider were wild.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then when the knight to the hunting field came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode as he sought rather death than his game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He halloo'd through woods where he wandered of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lost Lady Mary he never saw more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no one durst ride in the track where he led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fearful his leaps, and so madly he sped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his wild phrenzy he gallop'd one day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the church steps at Rochdale, and up the same way.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The practice of giving a local name and local significance to this
tradition and its hero has been previously shown to be by no means
unusual. At Fontainebleau Odin is transformed into Hugh Capet;
the ancient British king, Hegla, rode at the head of the hunt on the
banks of the Wye, in the reign of Henry II.; King Arthur, in
Normandy, Scotland, and other places, is elevated to the post of
honour; in Sleswig it is the Duke Abel; and at Danzig it is Theordoric
the Great. Wordsworth, in the lines quoted at the head of
this chapter, designates the personage who hunts with Gabriel's
hounds as an "impious lord."</p>

<p>The mythical connection between unwearied but unwilling toil and
arrogance and presumption is referred to by the Rev. G. W. Cox in
the following terms:&mdash;"The myth of Ix&icirc;&ocirc;n exhibits the sun as bound
to the four-spoked wheel which is whirled round everlastingly in the
sky.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In that of Sisyphos we see the same being condemned to the
daily toil of heaving a stone to the summit of a hill from which it
immediately rolls down. This idea of tasks unwillingly done, or of
natural operations as accomplished by means of punishment, is found
also in the myth of Atlas, a name which like that of Tantalos denotes
endurance and suffering, and so passes into the notion of arrogance
and presumption." In a note he adds,&mdash;"The Hellenic Atlas is
simply the Vedic Skambha."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>The story of the "spectre huntsman," under various modifications,
is found in different parts of the country. They seem invariably to
suggest the common origin to which I have referred, however much
it may be obscured by relatively modern additions or poetic embellishments.</p>

he was driving the cow to Sir Ralph's as the heriot due under the circumstance. He

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the traditionary beings which linger yet in the legends of
nearly every race or tribe, few are more universal than those relating
to giants or men of colossal size and superhuman power. Geoffrey
of Monmouth gravely informs us that, before the arrival of his
legendary Trojan, Brutus, Britain was "called Albion, and was inhabited
by none but a few giants." According to the same authority,
Ireland was originally peopled by a similar race of monsters. He
asserts that the magician Merlin transported the materials for the
building of Stonehenge from the Irish mountain Killaraus, to Salisbury
Plain. Merlin assured Uther Pendragon that the stones were
"mystical, and of a medical virtue," and that "the giants of old
brought them from the farthest coasts of Africa, and placed them in
Ireland while they inhabited that country."</p>

<p>The ancient Britons believed Stonehenge to have been built by
giants, hence its name, in their language, <i>Choir-gaur</i>, which signifies
the "Giant's Dance."</p>

<p>The earliest reliable notice of the British Islands is, however, to
be found in the work "De Mundo," section three, attributed to
Aristotle (B.C. 340). The writer says:&mdash;"Beyond the Pillars of
Hercules is the ocean which flows round the earth. In it are two
very large islands, called Britiannic; these are Albion and Ierne."</p>

<p>The Ramayana, which is the next Sanscrit work in point of age
to the Vedas, gives a singular account of the conquest of Ceylon, in
which some mythic giants and monsters appear together with monkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
warriors. Rama, by the aid of celestial weapons, conquered demons.
He obtained his wife, Sita, by snapping the bow of her gigantic
father. The said bow was conveyed from place to place by an eight-wheeled
carriage, drawn by eight hundred men! His wife having
been carried off through the sky by the demon monarch of Ceylon,
"at whose name heaven's armies flee," Rama entered into an alliance
with Sugriva, king of the monkeys, whose general, Hanuman, at
the head of his monkey army, aided Rama in the conquest of his
enemy's territory. The demon king was slain, and Sita recovered.
The latter successfully underwent the ordeal of walking through
blazing fire, in order to demonstrate her purity.</p>

<p>The confusion which existed in ancient times respecting wild men,
monsters, and some kind of gigantic ape or monkey, has had some
little light thrown upon it by the recent experiences of M. Du Chaillu
in Equatorial Africa. In his "Journey to Ashango-land," he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After reconsidering the whole subject, I am compelled also to state
that I think it highly probable that gorillas, and not chimpanzees, as
I was formerly inclined to think, were the animals seen and captured
by the Carthaginians under Hanno, as related in the 'Periplus.'
Many circumstances combine in favour of this conclusion. One of
the results of my late journey has been to prove that gorillas are
nowhere more common than on the tract of land between the bend
of the Fernand Vaz and the sea-shore; and, as this land is chiefly of
alluvial formation, and the bed of the river constantly shifting, it is
extremely probable that there were islands here in the time of
Hanno. The southerly part of the land is rather hilly, and, even
if it were not then an island, the Carthaginians, in rambling a short
distance from the beach, would see a broad water (the Fernand Vaz)
beyond them, and would conclude that the land was an island....
The passage in the 'Periplus,' which I mentioned in 'Equatorial
Africa,' is to the following effect:&mdash;'On the third day after sailing
from thence, passing the streams of fire, we came to a bay called the
Horn of the South. In the recess was an island like the first,
having a lake, and in this there was another island full of wild men.
But much the greater part of them were women with hairy bodies,
whom the interpreters called gorillas.... But, pursuing them,
we were not able to take the men; they all escaped from us by their
great agility, being <i>cremnobates</i> (that is to say, climbing precipitous
rocks and trees), and defending themselves by throwing stones at us.
We took three women, who bit and tore those who caught them, and
were unwilling to follow. We were obliged, therefore, to kill them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and took their skins off, which skins were brought to Carthage, for
we did not navigate further, provisions becoming scarce.'" Du
Chaillu adds his opinion that "the hairy men and women met with
were males and females of the <i>Troglodytes gorilla</i>. Even the name
'gorilla,' given to the animal in the 'Periplus,' is not very greatly
different from its native name at the present day, 'ngina' or 'ngilla,'
especially in the indistinct way in which it is sometimes pronounced."</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hunt seems to regard the giants of "old Cornwall" as
something generically distinct from those depicted in Mr. Dasent's
translation of Asbj&ouml;rnsen and Moe's collection of "Norse Tales."
He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May we venture to believe that the Cornish giant is a true Celt,
or may he not belong to an earlier race? He was fond of home, and
we have no record of his ever having passed beyond the wilds of Dartmoor.
The giants of Lancashire, and Cheshire, and Shropshire have
a family likeness, and are no doubt closely related; but if they are
cousins to the Cornish giants, they are cousins far removed."</p>

<p>So far from entertaining a doubt as to the common origin of these
mythical monsters, on account of the diversity of local costume
in which they are presented, I rather feel disposed to express
astonishment at the vast amount of similarity they yet retain, after
being subjected for centuries to so many diverse influences. The
Titans and the Cyclops, of the polished Greeks, some of whom are
said to have covered nine acres of land when laid on the earth; the
Go&euml;magot, who succumbed in the famous wrestling match to the
Trojan chief Corineus, on the cliff at Plymouth, and who, according
to Geoffrey of Monmouth, was twelve cubits high, and tore up huge
oak trees as if they were hazel wands; that prince of pedestrians,
Bolster, immortalised by the pencil and burin of George Cruickshank,
who took his six miles at a stride, over a Cornish valley, without discomfort;
the trolls and giants of the Norse, who, like their Greek
cousins, warred with the ascendant gods; the ogres and huge club-wielding
monsters of our nursery days, that in Lancashire, as in other
parts of England (Cornwall included), yielded to the prowess of the
redoubtable "Jack, the Giant-killer," or "Jack, the Tinkeard," present
too many corresponding family features and mental and physical
coincidences to permit a serious doubt of their common parentage.
The Teutonic giants of the German tales collected by the brothers
Grimm, bear unmistakable relationship both to those of Cornwall and
the north of England. Indeed, "Gogmagog," the very name of the
Shropshire colossus who was located in the ruins of the Roman city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Uriconium, is preserved in that of the Cornish giant wrestler above
referred to. There are Gog-Magog hills, too, near Cambridge; and
the Corporation of London yet retains the huge wooden images which
represent this mythic monster split into two, and converted into the
giant warders of the ancient city&mdash;the well-known Gog and Magog.
I have seen at Norwich two huge wooden dolls, which, if they do not
actually represent the said Gog and Magog, are evidently intended as
portraits of some very near relatives of those ponderous misshapen
relics of the past.</p>

<p>Much useless discussion has been devoted to the attempt to show
that mankind, or at least some portion thereof, in the "pre-historic
time," was of Cyclopean or gigantic stature. All known evidence of
a reliable character, however, condemns this hypothesis as untenable.
The power of ignorance and rumour to magnify small facts into monstrous
fictions is aptly illustrated by the story of the famous three
black crows. The deeds of a man of uncommon stature, or extraordinary
strength, would furnish, under certain circumstances, a sufficient
modicum of truth to lay the foundation of a most extravagant myth.
We have a modern illustration of the proneness of ignorant or superstitious
persons to hyperbole in matters of this kind, in the statements
of early voyagers anent the aborigines of Patagonia. Our early school
geographies informed us that this then relatively unknown portion of
South America was peopled by a race of giants. Indeed, I think it
was even intimated that these colossi were most probably the <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> descendants of the supposed mythical monsters of the days of
old. Some Spanish officers, in 1785, measured several of these
Patagonian giants, and they reported that the greatest monster of
the lot only reached seven feet one inch and a quarter! I can never
remember England being without two or three exhibited giants, who
would look with contempt upon such pretensions to the honours of
the caravan, to say nothing of the "reception room" of such "gentlemanly
freaks of nature" as Chang, the Chinese Anak, Mons. Brice,
or Captain Bates, with his colossal wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miss Swan. But
Captain Wallis informs us that, on his carefully measuring several
of these Patagonian prodigies, he found that the stature of the
greater part of them ranged between five feet ten inches and six feet!
The well-known regiment of grenadiers raised by Frederick William
the First, of Prussia, would have completely dwarfed these once
celebrated Patagonian Titans. One of them, a Swede, measured eight
feet six inches. "O'Brien, the Irish giant," who died in 1783, was
eight feet four inches in height. His real name was Byrne. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
skeleton is preserved in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons,
London. Chang, at nineteen years of age, was said to be seven feet
nine and a half inches in height. He stated that a deceased sister
was eight inches taller than himself! The proneness to exaggeration
or hyperbole to which I have referred was shared in even by such men
as Julius C&aelig;sar and Tacitus; or, at the least, they dealt largely in
the article at second-hand. They believed and recorded the then
vulgar notion that the German "barbarians," our own ancestors,
were a race of gigantic men.</p>

<p>Indeed the belief in giants and other monsters was almost universal
amongst the more educated section of the Roman people. Pliny
speaks of the existence of men in India whose height exceeded five
cubits. He assures his readers, on the most unimpeachable authority,
that "they are never known to spit, are not troubled with pain in the
head or teeth, or grief of the eyes, and seldom or never complain of
any soreness in any other parts of the body, so hardy are they, and of
so strong a constitution, through the moderate heat of the sun." He
likewise talks of a people who, having no heads, stand on their necks.
These monsters were said to carry their eyes in their shoulders. He
describes the Choromand&aelig; as a savage people, without a distinct
speech. Their bodies were rough and hairy. They gnashed their teeth
and made a hideous noise. Their eyes were red, and their
teeth of the canine order. This same India, according to Pliny,
possessed a great variety of other monstrosities, such as men without
noses, men with feet a cubit long, while those of their wives were so
small that they were called "sparrow-footed."</p>

<p>That such stories were ordinarily accepted as true, even in Shakspere's
days, is attested by the fact that the great poet and dramatist
places in the mouth of Othello, in his eloquent defence before the
senate of Venice, when explaining his method of courtship, the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Amorites, the most important tribe of the aborigines of
Palestine, are described in the Jewish Rabbinical writings as of enormous
stature. Amos indeed, speaks of them, figuratively, as being
as high as cedars and as strong as oaks. It is stated in Deuteronomy
that the iron bed of Og, King of Bashan, was nine cubits long and
four in breadth. This bed, however, by some, is believed to have
been really a kind of divan. The Rabbinical writers were not, however,
content with even a literal interpretation of these passages.
In the <i>Jalkut Shimoni</i> we are told that Moses informed Azr&auml;el, the
Angel of Death, that the dimensions of Og and Sihon were so great
that they escaped drowning at the great Deluge, the water of which
reached no higher than their ancles! According to the <i>Sevachir</i>, Og
placed his feet on the fountains of the Great Deep, and, by putting
his hand on the windows of Heaven, he stopped the Deluge! On
the water being made so hot, however, that the monster's lower
extremities became parboiled, he was compelled to desist. He nevertheless
mounted the ark, and survived the great catastrophe. He
was said to consume daily one thousand oxen, one thousand head
of game, and one thousand measures of wine. He was a famous
hand at uplifting mountains and other objects of similarly trifling
magnitude! He met with a mishap, however, whilst conveying a
rock "three miles in extent," with which he proposed to annihilate
the Israelitish army at one blow! We are further informed that
Joshua, who was ten ells high, perceiving that the rock was crumbling
to pieces around the giant's shoulders, struck him on the ancle
with an axe ten ells in length, and thus lamed him for life. Sihon
was so powerful that no creature on earth could withstand him. It
seems, however, that he derived his strength not altogether from his
immense physique, but from a demon with which he was connected,
inasmuch as the Israelites speedily vanquished both him and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
gigantic Amorite followers, after the said demon had been effectually
confined in chains. The Amorites may have been men of large
stature in comparison with the surrounding tribes. This is by no
means improbable. Two recent travellers, Mr. Porter and the Rev.
Cyril Graham, testify to the Cyclopean character of the remains of
some of the ancient cities of Bashan, which they succeeded in discovering,
after infinite toil and fatigue, the former in 1853 and the
latter in 1857. Some of the houses are described as being built of
immense masses of squared stones of the neighbouring basalt rock,
without mortar or other cement, with an enormous basaltic "flag"
for the roof, and a similar one for a door or gateway. Some of the
latter Mr. Graham found still in position, and capable of being turned
on the stone pivots which supplied the place of hinges.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, in his "Juventus Mundi," contends that the "Cyclops,
a godless race," are the children of Poseidon, and that Poseidon
(the Greek Neptune) was the chief god of the Ph&#339;nicians. He adds,
"Syria was inhabited by Canaanites; and it has been observed that
the names given in Scripture to that race indicate great stature and
physical force, which became the basis of a tradition that they were
a race of giants. To the Greek mind this would naturally convey
that they were the children of Poseidon, as the Ph&#339;nician god."</p>

<p>The ruins at Baalbec, and the sites of other ancient Ph&#339;nician
cities, present numerous specimens of colossal masonry, of most
extraordinary dimensions. In a wall at Baalbec three large blocks of
stone are described as still <i>in situ</i>, at the height of twenty feet from
the ground, which measure each twelve feet in width, twelve feet in
depth, and sixty feet in length. Mr. John D. Baldwin, in his "Pre-historic
Nations," contends that the ancient Ph&#339;nicians were of
Cushite of Hamite origin. Speaking of their stupendous architectural
remains, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Cushite origin of these cities is so plain that those most
influenced by the strange monomania which transforms the Ph&#339;nicians
into Semites now admit that the Cushites were the first
civilisers in Ph&#339;nicia. These old builders, whose sculpture produced
such astonishing effects in coarse rock, resorted to wood and metal
for the finish and ornamentation of their work. The stone they used
was not Parian marble, therefore they covered it with ornament of
another material, and 'what remains of their monuments is not the
monument itself, but the gross support that served to bear the whole
system of decoration under which the stone was concealed.'"</p>

<p>In relatively recent times, India appears to have been regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
especially the land of giants, marvels, and enchantments. Honest
old Sir John Mandeville, in his quaint, credulous, innocent way, tells
us that there are, in one of the Indian islands, "folks of great stature,
as giants, and they be hideous to look upon, and they have but one
eye, and that is in the middle of the front, and they eat nothing but
raw flesh and raw fish." He further adds that they were clothed in
the skins of beasts, they drank milk, preferred man's flesh to all other
food, and they had no houses to live in. In another Indian island,
Sir John tells us he was informed that giants dwelt "of great stature&mdash;some
fifty cubits long;" but he adds, with commendable caution, "I
saw none of these, for I had no lust to go to those parties, because no
man cometh neither into that Isle nor into the other, but he is
devoured anon. Men say that many times the giants take men into
the sea out of their ships and bring them to land, two in one hand
and two in another, eating them going, all raw and all quick."</p>

<p>The extravagance manifested in these giant legends may have
arisen from two distinct sources, besides the one to which I have
alluded. In the first place <i>giant</i> did not originally mean bulk or
extraordinary height. The Hebrew word <i>nephilim</i>, used in the Bible,
according to Dr. Derham, is sometimes employed to signify "<i>violent</i>
men," and it is translated by a word carrying such a meaning by
several ancient writers. He considers that "monsters of rapine and
wickedness" are referred to rather than giants in stature. And it is
perfectly true that vice and violence are almost always characteristic
of these legendary huge-limbed gentry; while the conqueror, who
represents the better morals of the age of the myths, is generally of
the dimensions of ordinary humanity.</p>

<p>The discovery of certain fossil bones of colossal size for a time
seemed to countenance the belief in the physical existence of this
mythic race. Buffon, indeed, describes and figures large bones as the
remains of giants, which are now well known to pertain to a species
of extinct fossil elephant.</p>

<p>In a letter from Dr. Mather to Dr. Woodward, published in the
Royal Society's Transactions, reference is made to a discovery, at
Albany, in New England, in 1705, of enormous bones and teeth.
The doctor calls them the bones of a giant, and refers to them as
corroborative of the statement in Genesis, c. 6, v. 4. The bones
in question, however, turned out to belong to the great American
fossil pachyderm, the <i>Mastodon giganteus</i>. There is a tradition amongst
the red Indians, that a race of men, relatively large in stature, existed
contemporaneously with these animals, and that both were destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
by the Great Spirit with thunderbolts. One account says,&mdash;that "as
a troop of these terrible quadrupeds were destroying the deer, the
bisons, and the other animals created for the use of the Indians, the
'Great Man,' slew them all with his thunder, except the Big Bull,
who, nothing daunted, presented his enormous forehead to the bolts,
and shook them off as they fell, till, being at last wounded in the side,
he fled towards the great lakes, where he is to this day."</p>

<p>Dr. Hitchcock, in one of his geological works, informs us that
"Felix Plater, Professor of Anatomy at Basle, referred the bones of
an elephant, found at Lucerne, to a giant at least nineteen feet high,
and, in England, similar bones were regarded as those of the fallen
angels!"</p>

<p>The discovery of remains of a fossil elephant beneath the cliff at
Plymouth was not very long ago held by some to furnish demonstrative
evidence not only of the strictly historical character of Geoffrey
of Monmouth's idle romance respecting the landing of Brute and his
Trojans in England, but of the precise locality where the mythic
champion wrestler, Corineus, hurled the equally mythic giant, Gogmagog,
from the cliff into the sea!<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>At Coggeshall, in Essex, similar remains have been found. One
of the earliest notices of these interesting discoveries is by old Norden,
who says that at Coggeshall "ther were to be seene 2 teeth of a
monstrous man or gyant of so great magnitude and weight as 100 of
anie men's teeth in this age cannot countervayle one of them."</p>

<p>White Watson alludes to the discovery, last century, of the skull of
a fossil elephant, at Wirksworth, in Derbyshire, which was commonly
believed at the time to be the brain-pan of an enormous giant.</p>

<p>In the second place, it does not appear a difficult matter to recognise
in these giant legends, one form in which the memory of the
dethronement of the gods of the various Aryan myths has been
preserved. In fact, the very feats performed by the giants in Cornwall,
such as the hurling of huge rocks, and striding across valleys,
are, as I have previously shown, attributed in Lancashire and the
north of England to the devil. A tradition yet exists that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Roman highways, which cross each other not far from Fulwood
Barracks, near Preston, extended from the North Sea to the South
Sea, and from the East Sea to the West Sea, and that the devil
made them himself in one night. Indeed in mythical and traditionary
lore, giants and devils are frequently convertible personages.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Russel Wallace, in his "Malay Archipelago," tells us that
the present inhabitants of the island of Java, "who now only build
rude houses of bamboo and thatch," look upon the ruins of the
colossal edifices, the remarkable examples of ancient sculpture, and
other evidences of the extinct civilisation amidst which they dwell,
"with ignorant amazement," and regard them as "the undoubted
productions of giants or of demons." The mythology of the Southern
Aryans presents a similar confusion; their tribe of demons, the R&acirc;kshasas
or Atrins (devourers), Kelly regards as the "earliest originals
of the giants and ogres of our nursery tales. They can take any form
at will, but their natural one is that of a huge misshapen giant
'like a cloud,' with hair and beard of the colour of red lightning.
They go about open-mouthed, gnashing their monstrous teeth and
snuffing after human flesh. Their strength waxes most terrible in
twilight, and they know how to increase its effect by all sorts of magic.
They carry off their human prey through the air, tear open the living
bodies, and with their faces plunged amongst the entrails they suck
up the warm blood as it gushes from the heart. After they have
gorged themselves they dance merrily." These R&acirc;kshasas, certainly
look very like the originals of the monsters described by Sir John
Mandeville.</p>

<p>The story of the Titans, overthrown by Zeus, and cast into Tartarus,
is the Hellenic form of this giant myth, which Milton has imitated
in his Paradise Lost, where Satan and his host, formerly angels and
archangels, are hurled from heaven into the bottomless pit. Milton's
devils are, in fact, veritable giants. Speaking of Satan, the poet
describes him as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>The "mission" of these Pandemonium giants is precisely analogous
to that of the rest of the fraternity. Satan says to Beelzebub,&mdash;</p>

<p>The trolls and giants of the Norse traditions are evidently but
other forms of the common myth, notwithstanding the metamorphoses
which they, in some respects, seem to have undergone. Dasent points
out some kinder qualities which the giants occasionally exhibit. He
says:&mdash;"One sympathises, too, with them, and almost pities them as
the representatives of a simple primitive race, whose day is past and
gone, but who still possessed something of the innocence and virtue
of ancient times, together with a stock of old experience, which,
however useful it might be as an example to others, was quite useless
to help themselves." Yet he regards them as the embodiment of
"sheer brute force," which yields to the "slight and lissom foe"
representing virtue and reason. The "upstart &AElig;sir gods," to whom
they are opposed, are described as endowed with "that diviner wrath
which, though burning hot, was still under the control of reason."
The trolls, on the contrary, are subject to wild paroxysms of merely
brutal animal rage, which discloses their true parentage. The fact
that their enemies, the &AElig;sir gods, were afterwards dethroned, and
stigmatised, along with the classical deities, as cacod&aelig;mons, and
became associated with the giants as evil spirits, will perhaps explain
why some of the race have been endowed with attributes which do
not pertain to the rest. It appears that they knew of their common
destiny; that they sometimes suspended hostilities, and even intermarried;
and looked forward with joint melancholy gloom to that,
to them, awful day, "the twilight of the gods," when both should
fall before the light of the Christian revelation.</p>

<p>The Venerable Bede, in describing the martyrdom of St. Alban,
expressly states that the magistrate or judge "was standing at the
altar, and offering sacrifice to devils," the said devils being the gods
of the Romans. He afterwards informs us that, when the bishops
Germanicus and Lupus were on a voyage to Britain, "on a sudden
they were obstructed by the malevolence of demons, who were jealous
that such men should be sent to bring back the Britons to the faith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
They raised storms and darkened the sky with clouds." Their efforts
were fruitless, nevertheless, as the piety of the bishops prevailed
against them. The Old Nick of the English, literally the devil, is
but one form of Odin dethroned. Professor Henry Morley, in his
"English Writers," says,&mdash;"Odin, under the name of Nikarr, from a
root signifying stroke of violence, which appears in the Greek <span title="nik&ecirc;">&#957;&#8055;&#954;&#951;</span>
victory; in the Latin <i>necare</i> and Anglo-Saxon <i>n&aelig;can</i>, to kill; and in
the English Knock; having been first cut up into Nickers, has become
the Old Nick of more recent times."</p>

<p>Dasent speaks of the trolls "as more systematically malignant than
the giants, and with the term were bound up notions of sorcery and
unholy power." He justly adds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But mythology is a woof of many colours, in which the hues are
shot and blended, so that the various races of supernatural beings are
shaded off and fade away almost imperceptibly into each other; and
thus, even in heathen times, it must have been hard to say exactly
where the giant ended and the troll began. But when Christianity
came in and heathendom fell; when the godlike race of the &AElig;sir
became evil demons instead of good genial powers, then all the objects
of the old popular belief, whether &AElig;sir, giants, or trolls, were mingled
together in one superstition, as 'no canny.' They were all trolls, all
malignant, and thus it is that, in these tales, the traditions about
Odin and his underlings, about the frost giants, and about sorcerers
and wizards, are confused and garbled; and all supernatural agency
that plots man's ill is the work of <i>trolls</i>, whether the agent be the arch
enemy himself, or giant, or witch, or wizard."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt appears to regard some of the giant traditions of Cornwall
as having direct reference to the aboriginal inhabitants of the
country. There may be some truth in this, as the existence of such
demi-giants as his Tom, who defeated giant Blunderbus by the skilful
employment of the wheel and axle of his wagon, would seem to indicate.
The wheel and axle, however, is an Aryan sun emblem, and
one type of the "chark" or "fire-bringing" instrument, invented,
according to the Greeks, by Prometheus. This unquestionably demonstrates
its descent from the ancient solar myths. Conquered men
driven to the caves and mountain fastnesses, and addicted to violence
and cruelty, would soon be described figuratively by language which
literally referred to older superstitions; just as we now designate
sanguinary savages as monsters, fiends, and even "devils incarnate."
This, no doubt, offers the most probable interpretation of the Gog-Magog
story, as well as of many others of its class. Dasent says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Between this outcast nomade race, which wandered from forest
to forest, and from fell to fell, without a fixed place of abode, and the
old natural powers and frost giants, the minds of the race which
adored Odin and the &AElig;sir soon engendered a monstrous man-eating
cross-breed of supernatural beings, who fled from contact with the
intruders as soon as the first great struggle was over, abhorred the
light of day, and looked upon agriculture and tillage as a dangerous
innovation which destroyed their hunting fields, and was destined
finally to root them out from off the face of the earth."</p>

<p>Mackenzie informs us that the Esquimaux with whom he conversed
had a tradition that the English were giants, with wings, who could
kill with a glance of their eye, and swallow at a mouthful an entire
beaver.</p>

<p>If the European emigrants who have conquered North America
from the Red Indian, and nearly extirpated his race, had been as
superstitious as their forefathers were some two or three thousand
years ago, we should have had a similar class of mixed myths
resulting from their warlike contact. Indeed, we have, notwithstanding
the influence of Christianity, some faint indications that the
superstitious element in this direction has not yet completely died out.</p>

<p>Many of these mythic giants are little more than degraded forms
of the original Aryan personifications of the forces of Nature. Rivers
have been deified, and so have mountains. Atlas was a giant, who
held the earth on his shoulders. The one-eyed Cyclops, with the
deformed Vulcan at their head, forging thunderbolts in a cave at
Mount Etna, personify volcanic force. Giants were supposed to be
buried alive at the base of such mountains as Etna, Stromboli, and
Vesuvius, and their struggles to free themselves the cause of the
earthquakes and other terrestrial convulsions to which the localities
were specially subjected. The whirlpool and rock in the Straits of
Messina, which cause no special alarm to modern navigators, created
so much terror in the minds of ancient sailors, and made such havoc
of their frail craft, that they became regarded as malicious demons,
and were named Scylla and Charybdis. The noise of the furious
waves, dashing upon the rocky cavernous coast, fancy likened to the
howling of dogs and wolves. Hence the fable that a female monster,
surrounded by troops of such animals, prowled about the neighbourhood,
awaiting the opportunity of devouring mariners wrecked on the
coast. The celebrated basaltic rock in the north of Ireland was called
the "Giant's Causeway" simply because the early inhabitants, knowing
nothing of geology, thought it a result of superhuman or demoniacal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
labour. The equally celebrated cave in Derbyshire, doubtless,
received the name of the "Devil's Hole" for a similar reason. Many
of Mr. Hunt's Cornish giants live in the violently upheaved masses
of granite which receive the Atlantic tempests in their wildest fury.
Some, indeed, having become more modernised, live in castles on the
rocky mountains. Others of these myths have become entangled
with the Tregeagle traditions, which, I have previously shown,
embody much of the Teutonic "wild hunt" or "furious host"
superstitions.</p>

<p>The Rev. George W. Cox, in his "Mythology of the Aryan Nations,"
contends that the beings spoken of as Cyclops in the Iliad and the
Odyssey, are personifications of distinct natural forces. The former he
says "are manifestly the dazzling and scorching flashes which plough
up the storm-clad heavens." In the latter the phenomenal features
are of a very different character. Polyph&ecirc;mos is "the son of Poseidon
(Neptune) and the nymph Tho&ocirc;sa; in other words he is emphatically
the child of the waters, and of the waters only&mdash;the huge mists
which wrap the earth in a dark cloud." The one-eyed monster,
blinded by Odysseus, is the sun himself, shorn of his beams, glaring
ghastly through the blackening mist. He says:&mdash;"This terrible
being may be seen drawn with wonderful fidelity to the spirit of the
old myth in Turner's picture of the overthrow of the troops sent by
Cambyses to the shrine of the Lybian Ammon; and they who see
the one-eyed monster glaring down on the devoted army, where the
painter was probably utterly unconscious that he was doing more than
representing the simoom of the desert, will recognise at once the
unconscious accuracy with which the modern painter conveys the old
Homeric conception of Polyph&ecirc;mos. In this picture, as in the storms
of the desert, the sun becomes the one great eye of an enormous
monster, who devours every living thing that crosses his path, as
Polyph&ecirc;mos devoured the comrades of Odysseus. The blinding of
this monster is the natural sequel when his mere brute force is pitted
against the craft of his adversary. In his seeming insignificance and
his despised estate, in his wayworn mien and his many sorrows,
Odysseus takes the place of the Boots or Cinderella of Teutonic folk-lore;
and as the giant is manifestly the enemy of the bright being
whose splendours are for the time being hidden beneath a veil, so it
is the representative of the sun himself who pierces out his eye; and
thus Odysseus, Boots, and Jack the Giant-killer alike overcome and
escape from the enemy, although they may be said to escape with the
skin of their teeth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Grimm relates a Norwegian legend, which clearly indicates that
many of these gigantic monsters of the old mythologies were simply
impersonations of elemental strife or powerful natural forces. Olaf,
the saint and king, being anxious to build a very large church without
taxing heavily his people, bargained with a giant or troll, who undertook
the labour on condition that he should receive as his reward the
sun and the moon, or, in default, the royal saint himself. When the
immense structure was nearly completed, Olaf wandered about in
sore dismay, wondering how the giant's demand could be met.
Suddenly he heard a child crying in the inside of a hill or small
mountain. On listening attentively, he overheard a giantess say
to the child these words:&mdash;"Hush! hush! to-morrow, <i>Wind and
Weather</i>, your father, will come home and bring with him the sun and
the moon, or St. Olaf himself." It appears that the simply calling
an evil spirit by his name was sufficient to utterly annihilate him.
So Olaf marched up with a bold front to the giant, and said,&mdash;"<i>Wind
and Weather</i>, you have set the spire awry!" The giant suddenly fell
from the top of the edifice, and was smashed to pieces. And further,
each piece was found to have become converted into a flint stone!</p>

<p>Giants were introduced pretty freely, especially during the earlier
period of modern English literature, into allegorical works both in
prose and poetry. There is a forcible illustration of this in Stephen
Hawe's "Pastime of Pleasure." Prince Graunde Amour, goes forth
in search of adventures. False Report, a dwarf, deceives him, but
he slays a giant with three heads, named Imagination, Falsehood,
and Perjury. John Bunyan, too, has his Giant Despair, etc., and
others will readily occur to the reader's mind. In the Arthurian
romance of Sir Gawayne, that hero is said to have been endowed
with "supernatural increase and decline of strength that <i>corresponded
to the movement of the sun</i>." This is not without significance, as a
personification of natural force. It corresponds, too, in a remarkable
degree, with Mr. Cox's interpretations of some of the elder Greek
myths.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon, in his "Wisdom of the Ancients," referring to what
is called the allegorical theory, as a method of interpreting the ancient
mythology, says,&mdash;"I freely and willingly confess that I am inclined
to the opinion, that not a few of the fables of the antient poets
contained from their very origin a hidden mystery and allegory, for
who can be so obstinately blind to evidence, that, when he hears that
after the extermination of the giants, Fame was brought forth as a
posthumous sister to them, he does not immediately apply the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to these party murmurs and seditious rumours which are wont to
spread themselves amongst a people for a while after the suppression
of rebellions? Or when he hears that the giant Typhon cut away
and carried off the sinews of Jupiter, and that they were stolen from
him, and restored to Jupiter by Mercury; how can he but perceive
immediately that this is to be referred to powerful rebellions, by
which the sinews of kings, their revenue and authority, are cut out;
yet not so but by mildness of address and wisdom of edicts, as it
were by stolen means, the minds of subjects within a short time are
reconciled, and the power of kings restored to them. Or when he
hears that in that memorable expedition of the gods against the
giants, the ass of Silenus became by his braying an instrument of
great value in dispersing these giants; must he not clearly see that
this was imagined of those vast projects of rebels, which are mostly
dissipated by light rumours and vain consternation? There is also
another not unimportant an indication of the existence of a hidden
and involved sense; namely, that some of the fables are so absurd
and senseless in their outward narration, that they seem to show
their nature at first sight, and cry for exposition by means of a
parable. Above all, one consideration has been of great weight and
importance with me&mdash;that most of the fables of mythology appear by
no means to have been invented by those who relate them, such as
Homer, Hesiod, and the rest; for where it clearly made manifest to
us that they proceeded from that age and those authors by whom they
are celebrated, and thence transmitted to us, we should surely, I conjecture,
not have been induced to expect anything great or lofty from
such an origin as this. But he who considers the subject more
attentively will discover that they are related to posterity as things
already received and believed, not then for the first time imagined
and offered to mankind. And this it is which has increased their
estimation in my eyes, as being neither discovered by the poets themselves
nor belonging to their age, but a kind of sacred relics, the light
air of better ages, which, <i>passing through the traditions of earlier nations</i>,
have been breathed into the trumpets and pipes of these Grecians."</p>

<p>The passage of these giant traditions into the romances of modern
chivalry may easily be traced. King Arthur himself was a hero of
colossal proportions. He is still thought, as we have already seen,
like Barbarossa and others, to lie entranced in the recesses of more
than one mountain. He was attended by the magician Merlin,
and he and his followers performed superhuman feats. He slew
many giants of prodigious size, including Ritho, who had clothed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
himself in furs made from the beards of vanquished kings, and the
Spanish giant, who had borne away Helena, the niece of Hoel, and
fled with her to the top of St. Michael's Mount.</p>

<p>In Pulci's "Morgante Maggiore," Orlando, one of Charlemagne's
Paladins, slays the two giants, Passamont and Alabaster, and converts,
or rather accepts of the miraculous conversion of, a third,
Morgante, to Christianity.</p>

<p>The hero, Beowulf, the Ge&aacute;t, in the oldest Anglo-Saxon poem
extant, is believed by Kemble and others to be a personified warrior
form of Gautr, Odin's name in the Edda, as the god of abundance.
The giant Grendel, whom he slew, was a malignant demon that
carried desolation around. He is described as holding "the moors,
the fen, and fastnesses." Professor Morley, in his English summary
of the poem, says,&mdash;"Forbidden the homes of mankind, the daughters
of Cain brought forth in darkness misshapen giants, elves, and orkens,
such giants as warred long with God, and he was one of these."
This giant is believed to have had his haunt at Hartlepool, on the
coast of Durham. His mother, who was a kind of aquatic demon,
was thought to occupy a "bottomless" pool, from which the town,
in part, takes its name.</p>

<p>The King Arthur legend, which the Rev. John Whitaker locates at
Manchester, notwithstanding its relatively modern Norman-French
externals, still exhibits a strong flavour of the older traditions. According
to an episode in the "<i>Morte Darthur</i>," this Saxon champion,
Sir Tarquin, or Torquin, was giant enough to conquer and capture
three knights in one encounter. Indeed, he is sometimes described
as the "Giant." There is a tradition yet extant in the neighbourhood,
that the said Tarquin threw the huge stone, which lies by the
roadside near Longford Bridge, from his residence at Knot Mill, to
its present location, a distance of nearly two miles. The stone really
is the pedestal of an ancient cross, similar to the many yet to be seen
in various parts of Lancashire and Cheshire. It presents, however,
the peculiarity of two square mortise holes for the support of the
upright shaft. These, popular tradition says, Tarquin expressly
made for the insertion of his thumb and finger when engaged in hurling
the ponderous mass as a "quoit" or plaything. It is likewise said
to have been used, at some distant period, as a "plague-stone," and
that the two holes were filled with vinegar or some other disinfectant.
This story is not improbable. The sacred character of such a relic
would add to the faith of the neighbouring inhabitants in the efficacy
of the means adopted to avoid infection. It is said that provisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
etc., were left on or near the stone by the country people, and that
the towns-folk deposited the understood price in one of the holes containing
the vinegar, which was believed to render the coins innocuous
as plague conductors. Sir Lionel of Liones, the first of the brothers
of Sir Lancelot of the Lake, who succumbed to Tarquin's prowess
whilst endeavouring to rescue the three captives referred to, tells us,
"He never beheld so stout a knight, so handsome a man, and so well
accoutered a hero." He lived in a plain, surrounded by a dense
forest. His castle, John Whitaker says, was formed out of the ruins
of the Roman fortress at Castlefield, Manchester. Sir Ector de Maris,
another brother of Sir Lancelot, rambling in search of adventures,
and hearing that "within a mile was a castle, strong and well
ditched, and by it, upon the left hand, a ford; and that over this
grew a fair tree, on the branches of which were hung the shields
of the many gallant knights who had been overcome by the owner of
the castle; and at the stem was a basin of copper, with a Latin
inscription, which challenged any knight to strike it, and summon
the castellans to a contest. Ector came to the place, saw the shields,
recognised many that belonged to his associates at the Round Table,
and particularly noticed his brother's. Fired at the sight, he beat
violently on the basin, and then gave his horse drink at the ford.
And immediately a knight appeared on horseback behind him, and
called him to come out of the water. He turned himself directly.
He engaged the knight, was conquered, and taken prisoner by him."
The story goes on to relate that&mdash;"The brother of both these unfortunate
heroes, Sir Lancelot, whom we left sleeping before, in the
forest adjoining to the castle, <i>had been carried from thence by enchantment</i>,
and confined for some time." He, however, recovered his
liberty, and "in the midst of a highway he heard that a knight dwelt
very near, <i>who was the most redoubted champion that ever existed</i>, and had
conquered, and now kept in prison, no less than sixty-four of King
Arthur's knights. He hastened to the place. He came to the ford
and tree, and let his horse drink at the ford, and then beat upon the
basin with the end of his spear. This he did so long and so heartily,
that he drove the bottom out; and yet no one answered. He then
rode along the gates of the castle almost half an hour. At last he
descried Sir Torquin coming upon the road with a captive knight.
He advanced and challenged him. The other gallantly accepted the
challenge, defying him and all his fellowship of the Round Table.
They fought. The encounter lasted no less than four hours. Sir
Lancelot at last slew his antagonist, took the keys of his castle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
released all the prisoners within it, who instantly repaired to the
armoury there, and furnished themselves completely."</p>

<p>In a succeeding adventure, a few days afterwards, Sir Lancelot
encountered in the forest, at the entrance of a village, what the
romance terms a "foul churl," who "dashed at him with a great
club, full of iron spikes." Sir Lancelot, in return, drew his sword,
and "smote him dead upon the earth." He proved to be the porter
of a neighbouring castle, inhabited by "two great giants, well
armed save their heads, and with two horrible clubs in their hands."
Lancelot, nothing daunted, with his shield, "warded off one giant's
stroke, and clove the other with his sword from the head downward
to the chest. When the first giant saw that he ran away mad with
fear; but Sir Lancelot ran after him, and smote him through the
shoulder, and shove him down his back, so that he fell dead." This
victory released "a band of sixty ladies and young damsels," some of
whom had been imprisoned by the giants during seven years.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i>, in a recent paper on "Legends
of the Tichborne Family," says,&mdash;"The preservation of the Round
Table, or what was shown as such by Henry VIII. to Charles of
France, is due to them. This table is, I believe, shown in what are
the remains of the ancient chapel or church of St. Stephen, Winchester.
It is now riddled with Cromwell's bullets, having been
unsuccessfully defended against him by one of the Tichbornes and
Lord Ogle. Whether at such a table ever sat</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The faultless king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That passionate perfection,<br /></span>

<p class="noin">matters little. Who would not now say with the bard,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know the Round Table, my friend of old.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">We know it through its offsprings, 'Elaine,' 'Enid,' 'Guinevere,'
and a host of others. The table, with its twenty-four names, is the
origin of our romance of romances&mdash;<i>la creme de la creme</i>&mdash;of legends!"</p>

<p>Mr. Timbs, in "Historic Ninepins," says, "the existing representative
Round Table is of wood, and is preserved at Winchester,
and hangs upon the interior eastern wall of the County Hall. The
decorations of the table indicate a date not later nor much earlier
than the reign of Henry VIII., and the figure of Arthur has been
repainted within the time of living memory." King Edward III.
founded an order in commemoration of the British warrior, and in
1344 entertained the knights at Windsor Castle at a Round Table
two hundred feet in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Several circular mounds in various parts of England, including
a remarkable one near Penrith, are by traditionary wisdom each
honoured with the name of "King Arthur's Round Table." Bishop
Percy tells us that the term "round table" is not a speciality of
the King Arthur legends, but that it is common to all the ages of
chivalry. In support of this he refers to Dugdale's description of a
grand tournament given by Roger de Mortimer, at Kenilworth, in
the reign of Edward the First. Dugdale says,&mdash;"Then began the
Round Table, so called by reason that the place wherein they
practised those feats was environed with a strong wall made in a
round form." This is confirmed by an expression common with
Matthew Paris, when describing jousts and tournaments. He styles
them "<i>Hastiludia Mens&aelig; Rotund&aelig;</i>." Wace makes mention of the
Round Table of Arthur in his metrical romance, but Geoffrey of
Monmouth has no reference to it, either in his pretended "History,"
or in his "Life of Merlin." Nevertheless in the romance, the
"Morte Darthur," it is expressly stated that Merlin made it "in
token of the roundness of the world." It is evidently, like other circular
forms, a sun type, or phallic symbol. Ellis, in his "Specimens of
the Early English Romances," on the authority of the metrical one
of which Merlin is the hero, says,&mdash;"The Round Table was intended
to assemble the best knights in the world. High birth, great strength,
activity and skill, fearless valour, and firm fidelity to their suzerain
were indispensably requisite for an admission into this order. They
were bound by oath to assist each other at the hazard of their own
lives; to attempt singly the most perilous adventures; to lead, when
necessary, a life of monastic solitude; to fly to arms on the first
summons; and never to retire from battle till they had defeated the
enemy, unless when night interfered and separated the combatants."
The number of knights belonging to the order appears to have varied
at different times; but one hundred or upwards is most generally
referred to. The table was originally constructed by the magician
Merlin for Uther Pendragon, Arthur's father. It passed from him
to Leodigan, King of Carmalide, the father of Guenevere, the wife of
Arthur. The famous round table formed part of the dower of the
queen on her marriage with the popular hero.</p>

<p>The manner in which traditions sometimes become interwoven
with legends of more modern date is aptly illustrated by the fact
recorded in the "Vetus Ceremoniale" MS., and endorsed by Du
Cange, "that the chivalrous order of the Knights of the Round Table
was instituted by King Arthur and the Duke of Lancaster." If Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
ever lived at all, he lived in the fifth and sixth centuries. Geoffrey
of Monmouth says, after being mortally wounded, "he gave up the
crown of Britain to his kinsman, Constantine, the son of Cader, Duke
of Cornwall, in the five hundred and forty-second year of our Lord's
incarnation." Roger de Poictou, the first <i>Earl</i> of Lancaster, flourished
in the twelfth; and Henry, the first <i>Duke</i>, about a couple of centuries
afterwards! But dates are little regarded by those who traffic in the
"mythic lore" of the mysterious "olden time."</p>

<p>The Rev. G. W. Cox successfully shows that the principal materials
of the Arthurian legends are identical with those which underlie the
Hindoo, Grecian, Teutonic, and other Aryan myths. He contends
that Arthur is another phase of Achilleus, or Sigurd, or Perseus.
He says,&mdash;"Round him are other brave knights, and these not less
than himself must have their adventures; and thus Arthur and Balin
answer respectively to Achilleus and Odysseus in the Achaian hosts.
A new element is brought into the story with the Round Table, which
forms part of the dowery of Guinevere." This dowery he regards as
the equivalent of, and as fatal to him as the treasures of the Argive
Helen were to Menelaus. Referring to the "San Gr&aelig;al," he says,&mdash;"This
mystic vessel is at once a storehouse of food as inexhaustible
as the table of the Ethiopians, and a talismanic test as effectual as
the goblets of Oberon and Tristram. The good Joseph of Arimathea,
who had gathered up in it the drops of blood which fell from the
side of Jesus when pierced by the centurion's spear, was nourished
by it alone through his weary imprisonment of two and forty years;
and when, at length, having either been brought by him to Britain,
or preserved in heaven, it was carried by angels to the pure Titurel,
and shrined in a magnificent temple, it supplied to its worshippers
the most delicious food, and preserved them in perpetual youth. As
such it differs in no way from the horn of Amaltheia, or any other of
the oval vessels which can be traced back to the emblem of the
Hindu Sacti." He afterwards adds,&mdash;"The myth which corrupted
the worshippers of Tammuz in the Jewish temple has supplied the
beautiful picture of unselfish devotion which sheds a marvellous glory
on the career of the pure Sir Galahad."</p>

<p>The Arthur of romance is in fact the creation of writers of a later
age, or later ages, than the conquest of Britain by the Angles and
Saxons, and not of contemporary bardic historians. The British
chieftain, who fought against Ida and his Angles in the North of
England, and whose territory is believed to have extended from the
Clyde to the Ribble, with a varying boundary on the east, is named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Urien. He is the great hero of the bard Taliesin. Amongst his
other great qualities, the poet enumerates the following:&mdash;"Protector
of the land, usual with thee is headlong activity and the drinking of
ale, and ale for drinking, and fair dwelling and beautiful raiment."
Llywarch Hen, or the old, another Keltic poet, born about the year
490, incidentally mentions Arthur as chief of the Cymry of the
south, or, as Professor Morley puts it, "what Urien was in the
north, Arthur was in the south." Llywarch Hen was present at the
bloody battle in which his lord Geraint (one of the knights introduced
into the succeeding romances), and a whole host of British
warriors perished. The said bard likewise brought away the head of
Urien in his mantle, after his decapitation by the sword of an assassin.</p>

<p>Amongst the kings and lords who attended Arthur's first feast at
"Carlion," in Wales, was, according to Sir Thomas Malory's "Morte
Darthur," "King Uriens of Gore, with four hundred knights with
him."</p>

<p>The earliest of the written Arthurian romances are to be found in
the History of the Britons ascribed to Nennius, but who he was, or
when the work was compiled, is not known. Some ascribe it to the
end of the eighth, others to the end of the tenth century. Geoffrey
of Monmouth published his historical romance in the twelfth century.
He, however, in his dedicatory epistle to Robert, Earl of Gloucester,
acknowledges, somewhat regretfully, that he "found nothing said"
about Arthur and several other of his mythical Kings in either Gildas
or Bede. William of Malmesbury, in the first part of his history, speaks
of this semi-mythic warrior in the following terms: "That Arthur,
about whom the idle tales of the Bretons (nug&aelig; Britonum) craze to
this day, one worthy not to have misleading fables dreamed about him,
but to be celebrated in true history, since he sustained for a long time
his tottering country, and sharpened for war the broken spirits of his
people." This was most probably written a few years before the appearance
of Geoffrey's work. About forty years afterwards, his countryman,
Gerald, condemned Geoffrey's history as spurious. He had arrived
at this conclusion in the following singular manner. One Melerius,
a Welshman of Caerleon, had "an extraordinary familiarity with unclean
spirits," and he was enabled, by "their assistance, to fortel future
events.... He knew when anyone spoke falsely in his presence,
for he saw the devil; as it were, leaping and exulting on the tongue
of the liar.... If the evil spirits oppressed him too much the
Gospel of St. John was placed on his bosom, when, like birds, they
immediately vanished; but when that book was removed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
History of the Britons by Geoffry Arthur was substituted in its place,
they instantly reappeared in great numbers, and remained a longer
time than usual on his body and on the book!!" William of Newbury,
too, some half a century after the publication of Geoffrey's
work, repudiated it in the following emphatic manner:&mdash;"A certain
writer has come up in our times to wipe out the blots on the Britons,
weaving together ridiculous figments about them, and raising them
with impudent vanity high above the virtue of the Macedonians and
the Romans. This man is named Geoffrey, and has the by-name of
Arturus, because he cloaked with the honest name of History,
coloured in Latin phrase, the fables about Arthur, taken from the
old tales of the Bretons, with increase of his own.... Moreover,
in his book, that he calls the History of the Britons, how
saucily and how shamelessly he lies almost throughout, no one,
unless ignorant of the old histories, when he falls upon that book,
can doubt." William concludes with the following emphatic sentence:
"Therefore, as in all things we trust Bede, whose wisdom and sincerity
are beyond doubt, so that fabler with his fables shall be
straightway spat out by us all." Geoffrey's work was, as Professor
Morley observes, "a natural issue of its time, and is, indeed, the
source of one of the purest streams of English poetry." It was afterwards
abridged, translated, versified, and paraphrased. New fancies
were added, sometimes from Breton traditions, and sometimes from
the fertile brains of more modern poets and writers of romance.
The "Mort Artus," "The Quest of the Sangreal," and the
"Lancelot of the Lake" stories were written by Archdean Walter
Map, the friend of Gerald de Barri, commonly called Giraldus
Cambrensis. Map flourished during the latter portion of the twelfth
century. In 1485, Caxton printed a complete collection of the
Arthur legends, "after a copy," as he says, "unto me delivered,
which copy Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of certain books of
French and reduced it into English." It is entitled, "A Book of
the noble Hystoryes of King Arthur, and of certen of his Knyghtes,
which book was reduced in to Englysshe by Sir Thomas Malory,
Knight."</p>

<p>Some other giant traditions yet hold their ground in Lancashire
and the neighbourhood. One at Worsley, near Manchester, the seat
of the Earl of Ellesmere, appears to be but a duplication of the
Tarquin legend. Perhaps the immense tunneling, and the miles of
underground canal in connection with the Bridgewater Trust collieries,
and other results of Brindley's engineering skill, may have influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the relatively modern vulgar mind in the transference of the locality
of Tarquin's stronghold from Castlefield to Worsley. Or perhaps
the second adventure of Sir Lancelot, when he encountered the "foul
churl" and his giant masters, may have fastened itself upon this
locality.</p>

<p>Dorning Rasbotham, 1787, visited the township of Turton, in
Lancashire, for the purpose of inspecting what he described as the
"<i>Hanging</i> or <i>Giant's Stone</i>." He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The tradition of the common people is that it was thrown by a
certain giant, upon a certain occasion (the nature of which they do
not specify), from Winter Hill, on the opposite range, to this place;
and they whimsically fancy that certain little hollows in the stone
are the impression made by the giant's hand at the time he threw
it; but I own I could not find out the resemblance which was noticed
to me. It appears, however, to have long excited attention; for,
though it is a hard grey moor-stone, a rude mark of a cross, of about
seven inches by six, hath, apparently, at a very distant period of
time, been cut upon the top of it. It is elevated upon another piece
of rock; and its greatest length is fourteen feet, its depth in the
thickest part five feet eight inches, and its greatest breadth upon the
top, which is nearly flat, about nine feet. A thorough-going antiquarian
would call this a Druidical remain."</p>

<p>Traditions of this class are very common, especially in districts
were huge rocks lay apparently unconnected with the general
mountain masses. As I have previously observed, striated boulders,
brought from a great distance by what geologists term the "glacial
drift," are especially regarded as <i>d&eacute;bris</i> resulting from giant warfare
or amusement. Many rocks of this class lying to the south of Pendle
Hill, near Great Harwood, I am informed, are still looked upon by
the vulgar as stones which have been hurled by giants from the
surrounding hills. If we regard them as the "frost giants" of the
Scandinavian myths, it is by no means an inapt personification of
the gigantic force exhibited by iceberg or glacier action.</p>

<p>A tradition in the neighbourhood of Stockport yet asserts that on
the site of a ruined building, with the remains of a moat, called
"Arden or Hardon Hall," on the southern bank of the river Tame,
an ancient castle once existed. John O'Gaunt is said to have slept
in it. The tradition, moreover, further informs us that at some very
remote period a huge giant occupied the same fortress, and that he
and a colossal rival, on the Rother or Mersey at Stockport, carried
on a long desultory warfare by throwing stones and shooting arrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
at each other. The Arden monster, at length becoming disgusted at
the tediousness of this ineffectual style of combat, assembled his
retainers, attacked the Stockport giant in his stronghold, slew him,
and utterly exterminated his followers.</p>

<p>May not this tradition have some remote connection with the struggles
between the Christian Northumbrians and the Mercian pagans in
the seventh century? The Mersey formed then the boundary line
between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, as it now separates Lancashire
from Cheshire. Or, as John O'Gaunt is mixed up in some way with
it, may not an old legend have become confounded with events attendant
upon some of the insurrectionary movements of the early
Norman barons, or of the Wars of the Roses? Stockport was once a
strongly fortified position, and is yet considered one of the "keys of
the county of Lancaster."</p>

<p>The giant and the ogre seem to have eventually passed into the
tyrant lord, who imprisoned in the dungeons of his strong castle
captive knights who succumbed to his prowess, and fair maidens
whom he had abducted. The magical or sorcery element, likewise,
is still to be found clinging to similar modern stories; and, notwithstanding
the more polished manners and elegant costume in which
they are presented, they quite as much partake of the character of
the nursery tales about champions and ogres of the "Jack, the Giant-killer"
type, as modern gentlemen do of their savage aboriginal
ancestry. Hallam, referring to the plundering barons of the "middle
ages," and the legends engrafted upon their ferocious deeds, says:&mdash;"Germany
appears to have been, upon the whole, the country where
downright robbery was most unscrupulously practised by the great.
Their castles, erected on almost inaccessible heights among the
woods, became the secure receptacles of predatory bands, who spread
terror over the country. From these barbarian lords of the dark
ages, as from a living model, the romances are said to have drawn
their giants and other disloyal enemies of true chivalry."</p>

<p>The giants, as I have shown, are evidently of an age much earlier
than the medi&aelig;val barons, but they and their doings may have
furnished <i>nuclei</i> around which the older myths may be said to have
re-crystallised themselves. Hallam, again, when discussing the
question of chivalry, refers to the connection of the relatively modern
romances and the older traditions. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The real condition of society, it has sometimes been thought,
might suggest stories of knight errantry, which were wrought up
into the popular romances of the middle ages. A baron, abusing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
advantage of an inaccessible castle in the fastnesses of the Black
Forest or the Alps, to pillage the neighbourhood and confine travellers
in his dungeon, though neither a giant nor a Saracen, was a monster
not less formidable, and could, perhaps, as little be destroyed without
the aid of disinterested bravery. Knight errantry, indeed, as a profession,
cannot rationally be conceived to have had any existence,
beyond the precincts of romance. Yet there seems no improbability
in supposing that a knight, journeying through uncivilised regions
in his way to the Holy Land, or to the court of a foreign sovereign,
might find himself engaged in adventures not very dissimilar to those
which are the theme of romance. We cannot indeed expect to find
any historical evidence of such incidents."</p>

<p>The disinterested chivalrous motive of the knight-errants of
medi&aelig;val romance appears to have intimate relationship to the
unselfishness of the heroes of the Greek solar myths, whose toil was
always undergone for the benefit of others rather than themselves.
The knight-errants' devotion to their "lady-loves," especially in
some of its features, seems allied to the solar heroes' love for the
dawn-goddesses.</p>

<p>If "giants" represent so many mythical characteristics it is not
unlikely that something of the kind may be found in connection with
their corporeal antitheses, the dwarfs. Timbs, in his "Historic
Ninepins," has the following pertinent remarks on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tom Thumb, it is conjectured, if the truth should be discovered,
would be found to be a mythological personage. His adventure
bears a near analogy to the rite of adoption into the Brahminical
order, a ceremony which still exists in India, and to which the Raja
of Tanjore submitted many years ago. In Dubois's work there is an
account of a diminutive deity, whose person and character are
analogous to those of Tom Thumb. He, too, was not originally a
Brahmin, but became one by adoption, like some of the worthies in
the Ramayana. Compare the multiplicity of Tom Thumb's metamorphoses
with those of Taliesin, as quoted by Davies, we shall then
see that this diminutive personage is a slender but distinct thread of
communication between the Brahminical and Druidical superstitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Even independent of the analogy between his transformations and
those of Taliesin, his station in the court of King Arthur (evidently
the mythological Arthur), marks him as a person of the highest
fabulous antiquity in this island; while the adventure of the cow,
to which there is nothing analogous in Celtic mythology, appears to
connect him with India."</p>

<p>In the mythology of the southern Aryans, there are demon dwarfs,
as well as the demon giants previously referred to. The former are
termed Panis. Vishnu, at the request of Indra, assumed the form
of a dwarf, and obtained the famous boon of three paces from Bali,
the conqueror of the gods. According to the Ramayana, then "the
thrice-stepping Vishnu assumed a miraculous form, and with three
paces took possession of the worlds. For with one step he occupied
the whole earth, with a second the eternal atmosphere, and with a
third the sky. Having then assigned to the Asura Bali an abode in

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">There</span> may still be traced in Europe, and even in England, some
remains of the Eastern belief in metempsychosis, or the transmigration
of souls. The superstitious reverence for the robin, the wren,
and other birds of the Aryan lightning class, points to the belief that
the bodies of birds and animals were supposed to be sometimes
tenanted by the souls of men, and even by the gods themselves; or
at least, that the latter did frequently assume their forms for some
special purpose or other. Several nursery stories, such as "Beauty
and the Beast," "The White Cat," "Little Red Riding Hood," etc.,
yet very popular amongst others than the juvenile section of the
population, point in a similar direction. These stories are no mere
modern inventions. Mr. Cox regards "Beauty and the Beast" but
as one form of the Greek myth "Er&ocirc;s and Psych&ecirc;." One of the
favourite feats of the celebrated British magician, Merlin, was the
conversion of men into beasts. C&aelig;sar says: "It is especially the
object of the Druids to inculcate this&mdash;that souls do not perish, but,
after death, pass into other bodies; and they consider that, by this
belief more than anything else, men may be led to cast away the fear
of death, and to become courageous." Shakspere has several remarkable
references to this superstition, one of which is quoted at the head
of this chapter. Another instance occurs in <i>Hamlet</i>, in the scene
where Ophelia, in her mental aberration, quotes snatches of old
ballads. She says, "They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but we know not what we may be.
God be at your table."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Caliban, when remonstrating with the drunken Stephano and
Trinculo, on their dallying with the fine clothes at the mouth of
the cave of Prospero, instead of taking the magician's life at once,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will have none on't; we shall lose our time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all be turned to barnacles, or to apes<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="noin">The elfin sprite Puck, after placing the ass's head on to Bottom,
and terrifying Peter Quince's celebrated amateur <i>corps dramatique</i>,
exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.<br /></span>

<p>Another instance will be found in "The Twelfth Night," where
the clown, under the pretence of his being "Sir Topas, the Curate,"
questions Malvolio, when confined in a dark room, as a presumed
lunatic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mal.</i>&mdash;I am no more mad than you are; make the trial of it in any constant
question.</p>

<p><i>Clown.</i>&mdash;What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild-fowl?</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i>&mdash;That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.</p>

<p><i>Clown.</i>&mdash;What thinkest thou of his opinion?</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i>&mdash;I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.</p>

<p><i>Clown.</i>&mdash;Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness: thou shalt hold the opinion
of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess
the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.</p></div>

<p>At an early age, Walter Savage Landor transmitted to Dr. Samuel
Parr an essay on the origin of the religion of the Druids. His
biographer, John Forster, thus summarises its argument:&mdash;"It appeared
to Landor that Pythagoras, who settled in Italy, and had
many followers in the Greek colony of the Phoc&aelig;ans at Marseilles,
had engrafted on a barbarous and bloodthirsty religion the human
doctrine of the metempsychosis; for that finding it was vain to say,
'Do not murder,' as none ever minded that doctrine, he frightened
the savages by saying, 'If you are cruel even to beasts and insects,
the cruelty will fall upon yourselves; you will be the same.' He explained
also the 'beans' of the old philosopher in the exact way that
Coleridge took credit for afterwards originating; though in this both
moderns had been anticipated by sundry other discoverers, beginning
with Plutarch himself." The answer of the "kindly old scholar" is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
both learned and characteristic. He says, "I thank you for your very
acute and masterly reasoning about Pythagoras, but I am no convert
to his being in Gaul; for the doctrine of transmigration is much
older, and prevailed among the Celts and Scythians long before
Pythagoras. It is believed, even now, in the north of Europe, and
would naturally suggest itself to any reflecting barbarian. However,
you have done very well in your hypothesis."</p>

<p>According to Herodotus, the Egyptians were the first who believed
in the immortality of the soul. After the demise of the body the
soul was supposed to pass from one of the lower animals to another,
until it had been duly located in the forms of all, terrestrial, aquatic,
and winged. After this had been accomplished, the human form was
again assumed. Three thousand years were considered necessary to
the effecting of this complete metempsychosis.</p>

<p>The Pythagorean doctrine appears to have been originally regarded
in the light of a purification. One commentator thus summarises
it:&mdash;"The souls, previous to their entering into human bodies,
floated in the air, from whence they were inhaled by the process of
breathing at the moment of birth. At the moment of death, they
descended into the lower world, where they were probably supposed
to dwell a certain number of years, after which they again rose into
the upper world, and floated in the air, until they entered into new
bodies. When by this process their purification had become complete,
the souls were raised to higher regions, where they continued
to exist, and to enjoy the presence and company of the gods."</p>

<p>It is a general opinion that the history of no ancient sage or
philosopher has been so much obscured as that of Pythagoras. The
fables and miracles interwoven into the biographies of Porphyrius,
Diogenes Laertius, and Iamblicus, have largely contributed to this
result.</p>

<p>The Indoo doctrine, although differing slightly in detail, presents
sufficient resemblance both to that of Pythagoras and that of the
Egyptians to suggest their common origin. All agree in averring
that the souls of men, after death, pass into other bodies. A most
religious life, however, amongst the Indoos, exempted the individual
from the penalty of the metempsychosis, the soul, on its departure,
being immediately absorbed into the divine essence. Mr. Colebrooke,
in the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, published a translation
of some extracts from the <i>Brahma-s&uacute;tras</i>, or aphorisms on the
Vedenta doctrine by B&acirc;dar&acirc;yana, amongst which is the following,
bearing on this subject:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The soul passes from one state to another invested with a subtle
frame, consisting of elementary particles, the seed or rudiment of a
grosser body. Departing from that which it occupied, it ascends to
the moon, where, clothed with an aqueous form, it experiences the
recompence of its works; and whence it returns to occupy a new body
with resulting influence of its former deeds. But he who has attained
the true knowledge of God does not pass through the same stages of
retreat, but proceeds directly to reunion with the Supreme Being,
with which he is identified, as a river at its confluence with the sea
merges therein altogether. His vital faculties and the elements of
which his body consists are absorbed completely and absolutely; both
name and form cease; and he becomes immortal without parts or
members."</p>

<p>In the Welsh romance, "The History of Taliesin," composed not
earlier than the thirteenth century, though often attributed to the
sixth (the era of the poet) is a curious story of successive transformations.
Caridwen, the wife of Tegid Voel, had an ugly son she
desired to make learned as a set-off to his deformity. She procured
a cauldron, and proceeded to boil a charmed mixture in order to
procure "the three blessed drops of the grace of inspiration."
During her absence, the three charmed drops flew from the cauldron
on to the finger of one of her watchers, and he, sucking his finger, to
relieve himself of the pain, imbibed the inspiration. In fear, he took
to his heels, and she ran after him. What followed is thus given in
Professor Morley's summary of the romance in English:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And he saw her and changed himself into a hare. But she
changed herself into a grey-hound and turned him. And he ran
towards a river and became a fish. But she, in form of an otter,
chased him until he was fain to become a bird. Then she, as a
hawk, followed him, and gave him no rest in the sky. Just as he
was in fear of death, he saw a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor
of a barn, and dropped among the wheat and turned himself into one
of the grains. Then she transformed herself into a high-crested
black hen, and scratched among the wheat with her feet, and found
him out and swallowed him."</p>

<p>From this germ the woman, in due course, was delivered of a son,
who, after some romantic adventures, was named Taliesin, "the
shining forehead." The three drops had done their work effectually,
it seems, for he became a perfect prodigy.</p>

<p>Nash, in his "Christ's Teares over Jerusalem," published in 1613,
records a curious instance of faith in this transformation superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in England. He says, "They talk of an oxe that told the bell at
Wolwitch, and howe from an oxe he transformed himself to an old
man, and from an old man to an infant, and from an infant to a
young man."</p>

<p>In an old work, entitled a "Help to Discourse," published in 1633,
is the following passage:&mdash;"Q. Wherefore hath it anciently been
accounted good luck if a <i>wolfe crosse our way</i>, but ill lucke if a hare
crosse it?&mdash;A. Our ancestors, in times past, as they were merry
conceited, so were they witty; and thence it grew that they held it
good lucke if a wolf crost the way and was gone without any more
danger and trouble; but ill lucke if a hare crost and escaped them,
that they had not taken her." Lupton, in "Notable Things," published
in 1660, refers to Pliny as reporting "that men in ancient times did
fasten upon the gates of their towns the heads of <i>wolves</i>, whereby to
put away witchery, sorcery, or enchantment, which many hunters
observe or do to this day, but to what use they know not." Werenfels
informs us that when a "superstitious person goes abroad he is not
so much afraid of the teeth as the unexpected sight of a wolf, lest he
should deprive him of his speech." Brand, referring to the superstition
which asserts that if a wolf first sees a man, the latter is suddenly
struck dumb, says, "To the relators of this Icaligar wishes as many
blows as at different times he had seen wolves without losing his
voice. This is well answered." He further notices the belief "<i>that
men are sometimes transformed into wolves, and again from wolves into
men</i>," and adds, "Of this vulgar error, which is as old as Pliny's
time, that author exposes the falsehoods."</p>

<p>Many other authorities refer to this superstition. Giraldus Cambrensis
relates a story of a priest being addressed one evening,
on his way from Ulster to Meath, by a wolf, who informed him
that he belonged to a certain sept or clan in Ulster, "two of whom,
male and female, were every seven years compelled, through a
curse laid on them by St. Natalis, to depart both from their
natural form and from their native soil." They therefore took
the form of wolves. If alive at the end of seven years, two
others of the sept "took their places under like conditions, and
the first pair returned to their pristine nature and country." Camden
expresses his disbelief of a story he heard in Tipperary, that
there were men who every year were turned into wolves. Gervase,
of Tilbury, speaks of were-wolves being common in England in
his time (the thirteenth century); and reference is made to a
wolf-woman in the Mabinogion, or fairy tales of the Welsh, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
about the same period. King John, of England, was suspected of
being a were-wolf. It is asserted in an old chronicle that, in some
such capacity, he uttered such frightful noises, after he was laid in
his grave, in Worcester Cathedral, that the pious monks dug up his
body, and removed it from the consecrated ground. One of the
medi&aelig;val metrical romances, by an unknown English author, refers
to this superstition. It is a translation of the "<i>Roman de Guillaume
de Palerne</i>," and is entitled the "Romance of William the Werwolf."</p>

<p>Herodotus says the Greeks and Scythians settled on the shores of
the Black Sea regarded the Neurians as wizards, and asserted that
each individual was for a few days in the year transformed into a
wolf. He speaks of a race of men who slept for six months at a time,
and of others who could change themselves at will into the shape of
wolves, and as easily resume their original form when desirable.
He talks likewise of the Troglodytes, or cave dwellers, a race of men,
who having no human language, screeched like bats, and fed upon
reptiles. They were likewise remarkable for their swiftness of foot.</p>

<p>Some of the Greek traditions represent the transformation of a
man into a were-wolf as a punishment for having sacrificed a human
victim unto a god. The offender was taken to the edge of a lake;
he swam over, and, on reaching the other side, was changed into a
wolf. In this condition he remained, roaming abroad with others
of the species, for a period of nine years. If during this time he had
abstained from eating human flesh, he resumed his original form,
which, however, had not been exempt from the influence of increased
age. There is remarkable coincidence in some respects between this
myth and that related by Giraldus Cambrensis previously referred to,
the significance of which Kelly justly regards as "worthy of note."</p>

<p>The Romans believed in the existence of the man-wolf, but attributed
the phenomenon to magical arts. Petronius has recorded an
incident which presents this superstition in a very graphic form.
One Niceros, at a banquet given by Trimalchio, relates the following
story:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It happened that my master was gone to Capua to dispose of
some second-hand goods. I took the opportunity, and persuaded our
guest to walk with me to our fifth milestone. He was a valiant
soldier, and a sort of grim water-drinking Pluto. About cock-crow,
when the moon was shining as bright as mid-day, we came amongst
the monuments. My friend began addressing himself to the stars,
but I was rather in a mood to sing or count them; and when I
turned to look at him, lo! he had already stripped himself and laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
down his clothes near him. My heart was in my nostrils, and I stood
like a dead man; but he made a mark round his clothes, and on a
sudden became a wolf. Do not think I jest; I would not lie for any
man's estate. But to return to what I was saying. When he became
a wolf he began howling, and fled into the woods. At first I hardly
knew where I was, and afterwards, when I went to take up his clothes,
they were turned into stone. Who then died with fear but I? Yet
I drew my sword, and went cutting the air right and left, till I
reached the villa of my sweetheart. I entered the court-yard. I
almost breathed my last, the sweat ran down my neck, my eyes were
dim, and I thought I should never recover myself. My Melissa
wondered why I was out so late, and said to me, 'Had you come
sooner you might at least have helped us, for a wolf has entered the
farm and worried all our cattle; but he had not the best of the joke,
for all he escaped, for our slave ran a lance through his neck.' When
I heard this I could not doubt how it was, and, as it was clear daylight,
I ran home as fast as a robbed innkeeper. When I came to
the spot where the clothes had been turned into stone, I could find
nothing except blood. But when I got home I found my friend, the
soldier, in bed, bleeding at the neck like an ox, and a doctor dressing
his wound. I then knew that he was a turnskin; nor would I ever
have broke bread with him again, no not if you had killed me."</p>

<p>In Germany many strange stories are told respecting these transformations.
The result of wounding a were-wolf generally appears
to be that the human shape is speedily resumed, but the injury
inflicted remains notwithstanding. One of these stories is to the
following effect:&mdash;A farmer and his wife were haymaking together,
when suddenly the wife requested her husband to throw his hat at
any wild beast that might come in his way. She then immediately
disappeared. Soon afterwards a wolf was perceived to be swimming
across a neighbouring river in the direction of the party of haymakers.
The farmer, remembering his wife's injunction, threw his hat at the
wolf, which the ravenous beast seized and tore to pieces. One of the
men, however, stabbed the wolf with a pitchfork. This dissolved the
spell; the wolf-form disappeared, but the dead body of the farmer's
wife lay on the ground before the eyes of the astonished spectators!</p>

<p>These transformations are believed, in some instances, to be
effected by a mere change of the external covering, like that of the
cloud-maidens referred to in chapter I. of the present work. These
mythical ladies were said to possess "shirts of swan plumage," by
means of which they "transformed themselves into water foul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
especially swans." The "frost-giants," Thiassi and Suttungr, had
each an "eagle-shirt," in which disguise they warred against the
gods. The possession of these feathery garments was essential to
their retention of the power of transformation. A variety of myths,
fairy stories, etc., have sprung from the supposed capture and
marriage of these maidens by men who have discovered them bathing,
and stealthily appropriated their magic raiment. These swan-shirts,
in the more modern myths, become the supernatural garments
of the fairies, mermaids, etc., married to mortals, and without which
they find it impossible to leave their husbands and resume their elfic
nature.</p>

<p>On the west coast of Ireland the fishermen are loth to kill the seals,
which once abounded in some localities, owing to a popular superstition
that they enshrined "the souls of thim that were drowned at the
flood." They were supposed to possess the power of casting aside
their external skins, and disporting themselves in human form on the
sea-shore. If a mortal contrived to become possessed of one of
these outer coverings belonging to a female, he might claim her and
keep her as his bride. This seems to point to the origin of the stories
about "mermaids" and some similar sea monsters.</p>

<p>Dr. Hertz gives many examples of the prevalence of the were-wolf
superstition in Germany. In some instances the bear occupies the
place of the wolf. A girdle made of wolf or bear skin is supposed yet
to possess the power of transforming a man into one or other of these
animals. The skin of a man who has been hanged is considered
equally potent. The girdle must have a buckle which possesses
seven tags or tongues, and it is powerless when not affixed to the
body. One were-wolf could carry a cow in his mouth. He devoured
human beings, too, as well as cattle. He had, however, taught his
wife how to treat him when in his lupine form. "She used to unbuckle
his belt, and he became a rational man again." The wolf
and the murderer were frequently hung on the same gallows, hence
the old Saxon name for this structure, <i>varagtreo</i>, or wolf-tree. The
mere certain recognition of a were-wolf is generally sufficient to
dissolve the spell. In cases of doubt, steel or iron is thrown over
the suspected animal. If this be done to a genuine were-wolf, "the
skin splits crosswise on the forehead, and the naked man comes out
through the opening." Kelly adds, "It frequently happens that the
were-wolf is frozen, that is to say, invulnerable by ordinary weapons
or missiles. In that case he must be shot with elder-pith, or with
balls made of inherited silver." The were-wolf of the eastern portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of the continent of Europe appears to be confounded with the vampire
superstition, as in the Sclavonic tongues the same word is used
to designate both these mythic monsters.</p>

<p>Baron Langon, in his "Evenings with Prince Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s," relates
a story of a vampire, or blood-sucker, named Rafin, on the authority
of the celebrated Fouch&eacute;. The astute chief of the police, if not
absolutely imposed upon, was, certainly, much perplexed with the
case. He says,&mdash;"I gave orders to have Rafin arrested, and he was
placed in confinement. I paid him a visit. He was strongly bound,
and in spite of his cries, supplications, and resistance, I resolutely
plunged into his flesh a surgical instrument, which, without producing
any injury, would cause an effusion of blood. When he perceived
my object he became furiously irritated, and made inconceivable
efforts to attack me. He threatened me with his future revenge;
but, heedless of his violence, I thrust the instrument into him. No
sooner did the first drop of blood appear than the six old wounds
opened afresh. All efforts to stop the bleeding proved fruitless&mdash;and
Rafin died." Some of the witnesses regarded the affair as a police
trick, Fouch&eacute; says,&mdash;"As to myself, I have sifted the matter deeply,
and I am perplexed to the last degree. I cannot admit the reality of
vampires; yet it is certain that I witnessed the facts I have stated."
Two women were said to have pined away and died, owing to their
intercourse with this man.</p>

<p>As recently as the year 1718, a solemn judicial enquiry took place
at Caithness respecting the sufferings of one William Montgomery,
who was reduced to a most miserable condition owing to the "gambols
of a legion of cats." In Kirkpatrick Sharpe's introduction to Law's
"Memorials," we read that the said Montgomery's man servant
averred that the feline disturbers of his master's peace "spoke among
themselves." The hypochondriac, at length, driven to desperation,
attacked the enemy with "broadsword and axe," and utterly routed
the caterwauling conclave, killing some and wounding others. The
said cats turned out to be veritable witches, as was proved by the
fact that two neighbouring "old women died immediately, and a
third lost a leg, which, having been broken by a stroke of the hatchet,
withered and dropped off."</p>

<p>It was customary, as recently as the sixteenth century, to punish
alleged were-wolves as remorselessly as supposed witches. Many
suffered at the stake. Kelly says, on the authority of Boquet (<i>Discours
des Sorciers</i>), that "a gentleman, looking out one evening from
a window of his ch&acirc;teau, saw a hunter whom he knew, and asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the man to bring him something on his return from the chase. The
hunter was attacked in the plain by a great wolf, and, after a sharp
conflict, cut off one of the fore paws with his hunting knife. On his
way back he called at the ch&acirc;teau, and putting his hand into his
game bag, to show the gentleman the wolf's paw, he drew out a
human hand with a gold ring, which the gentleman at once recognised
as his wife's. He looked for her, and found her in the kitchen
with one arm concealed under her apron, and, on uncovering it, saw
that the hand was gone. The lady was brought to trial, confessed(!),
and was burnt at Ryon. Boquet says he had this story from a trustworthy
person who had been on the spot a fortnight after the event."</p>

<p>In Denmark, Iceland, Germany, and the North of England, there
exist many similar stories, but they are more or less connected with
witchcraft, with which, indeed, they seem to have much in common.
The chief feature is the transformation of a man into a horse, by a
woman throwing a magic halter over his head while he is lying in
bed. The woman, who is a disguised witch, then mounts the horse
and gallops to the trysting place, where her compeers meet to revel.
If the man-horse can contrive to slip the magic bridle from his head,
and throw it over that of the woman, she is suddenly transformed
into a mare, and in turn is ridden almost to death by her previous
victim. One witch-mare, at Yarrowfoot, a few years ago, according
to Mr. Henderson, was found afterwards to be shod in the usual
manner, and sold to her own husband, who, on removing the bridle,
saw standing before him his wife, with a horseshoe nailed to each
hand and foot! Glanvil, in his "Saducismus Triumphatus," relates
an instance in which a "great army of witches" was charged with
performing this horse transformation feat on a large scale, at Blocula,
in Sweden, in 1669.</p>

<p>There is a German story of a joiner at B&uuml;hl, who, being troubled
with the nightmare, saw the elf enter his room, through a hole, in
the shape of a cat. He caught the animal and nailed one of its
paws to the floor. In the morning he was surprised to find his
feline prisoner transformed into a handsome young woman perfectly
naked. He married her, however; but, after they had had three
children, she disappeared suddenly, in the form of a cat, through
the hole by which she had entered, her husband having inadvertently
removed the material with which he had blocked it up.</p>

<p>In East Prussia, they have a story of a girl, who, without her
knowledge, was every evening transformed into a cat, and awoke
much fatigued. One night her lover caught a cat, which had regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
tormented and scratched him at night, and secured it in a sack.
The next morning he found the cat transformed into his naked sweetheart.
The story adds she was cured by the parson of the parish.</p>

<p>In 1633, a "second batch" of Lancashire witches was tried, found
guilty, and sentenced to death, at Lancaster; but after more elaborate
investigation into the circumstances, first at Chester, under the
presidency of the bishop, and afterwards at London, by the physicians
and surgeons to the king, and again by the king himself, Charles I.,
fully convinced of their innocence, extended to them his royal pardon.
The deposition of the principal witness, "Edward Robinson, sonne
of Edmond Robinson, of Pendle Forest, mason, taken at Padiham,
before Richard Shuttleworth and John Starkey, Esquires, two of
his Majestie's Justices of Peace," affords curious evidence of the
strength of this superstition little more than two centuries ago. The
deponent sayeth that at the time he was occupied in "gettinge Bullas
hee sawe two grey hounds, vizt., a blacke and a browne one, come
runninge over the next field towards him. He verilie thinketh the
one to be Mr. Butters and the other to be Mr. Robinsons, the said Mr.
Butter and Mr. Robinson then havinge such like. And the said
Grey Hounds came and fawned on him, they having about their
necks either of them a Coller, to either of which Collers was tyed a
strynge, which Collers, as this Informer affirmeth, did shine like
gold, and he thinkinge that some either of Mr. Butters or Mr.
Robinsons familie should have followed them, but seeinge noe bodie
to followe them, hee tooke the said Grey-hounds thinkinge to hunte
with them, and presentlie a hare did rise verie neere before him, at
the sight whereof he cried 'Loo, loo, loo,' but the doggs would not
runn, wherevpon hee beinge verie angrie tooke them, and with the
string that were at their Collers tyed either of them to a little bush
at the next hedge, and with a rodd that he had in his hand hee
beate them, and instead of the blacke grey-hound one Dickensons
wife stud vpp, a neighbour whom this Informer knoweth, and instead
of the browne Greyhound a little Boy, whom this Informer knoweth
not, at which sight this Informer being afrayd, endeavoured to runn
awaie, but beinge stayed by the woeman, vizt., Dickensons wife, shee
put her hand into her pocket, and pulled forth a piece of silver much
like to a fayre shillinge, and offered to give it him to hold his tongue,
and not to tell, which hee refused, sayinge, 'nay, thou art a witch,'
wherevpon shee put her hand into her pocket againe, and pulled out
a thing like unto a bridle that gingled, which shee put on the little
Boyes head which stood vpp in the browne greyhounds stead, wherevpon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the said Boye stood vpp a white horse. Then ymmediatlie
the said Dickensons wife tooke this Informer before her vpon the
said horse." As in the case previously referred to, the party galloped
off to a feast of witches. It is true Dr. Webster, who carefully
examined the witness, informs us, in his "Display of Witchcraft,"
that "the boy Robinson, in more mature years, acknowledged that
he had been instructed and suborned to make these accusations by
his father and others, and that, of course, the whole was a fraud."
Nevertheless, the belief in the probability of such transformations
must have been very general and deeply rooted, otherwise such impostors
could not have practised their villainy with the impunity they
did. Witches, we have previously seen, were often transformed into
hares. Margery Grant, the recently deceased Scotch witch, referred
to in a previous chapter, "believed herself to be transmutable, and
avers that she was, at times, actually changed by evil-disposed persons
into a pony or a hare, and rode for great distances, or hunted
by dogs, as the case might be."</p>

<p>Mr. A. Russel Wallace, in his "Malay Archipelago," says that
it is yet "universally believed in Lombock that some men have the
power to turn themselves into crocodiles, which they do for the sake
of devouring their enemies, and many strange tales are told of such
transformations." He adds that the islands of Bali and Lombock,
situated to the east of Java, "are the only islands in the whole
Archipelago in which the Hindoo religion still maintains itself&mdash;and
they form the extreme point of the two great zoological divisions of
the Eastern hemisphere."</p>

<p>The owl and the eagle, both lightning birds of the Aryan mythology,
received divine honours from the Greeks. The eagle was Jove's
emblem, the owl that of Pallas, or Athen&ecirc;. The latter was sometimes
called Glaucopis, or "owl-eyed," significant of the supernatural
light which was presumed to radiate from her lightning orbs.</p>

<p>The owl is not the only bird that is believed to have been transformed
into a human being skilled in the art of baking bread.
The cuckoo and the woodpecker have been subjected to a similar
metamorphosis. The legend of the owl and the baker's daughter
appears to be still popular in Gloucestershire. The story is generally
told with a view to prevent children and others from indulging in
harsh conduct towards the poor. Douce relates the legend in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our Saviour went into a baker's shop where they were baking,
and asked for some bread to eat: the mistress of the shop immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
put a piece of dough into the oven to bake for him; but was
reprimanded by her daughter, who, insisting that the piece of dough
was too large, reduced it to a very small size; the dough, however,
immediately began to swell, and presently became a most enormous
size, whereupon the baker's daughter cried out, 'Heugh, heugh,
heugh!' which owl-like noise probably induced our Saviour to transform
her into that bird for her wickedness."</p>

<p>Dasent, in his "Popular Tales from the Norse," gives a very
minute version of this tradition, in which the purely heathen superstition
is related with the nomenclature modernised. The names,
however, are its only Christian attributes. It markedly exhibits the
tendency of the vulgar to confound one mystery or tradition with
another, to which I have previously referred. Dasent gives the story
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In those days, when our Lord and St. Peter wandered upon
earth, they came once to an old wife's house, who sat baking. Her
name was Gertrude, and she had a red mutch on her head. They
had walked a long way, and were both hungry, and our Lord begged
hard for a bannock to stay their hunger. Yes, they should have it.
So she took a little tiny piece of dough and rolled it out, but as she
rolled it, it grew until it covered the whole griddle.</p>

<p>"Nay, that was too big; they couldn't have that. So she took a
tinier bit still; but when that was rolled out it covered the whole
griddle just the same, and that bannock was too big, she said; they
couldn't have that either.</p>

<p>"The third time she took a still tinier bit&mdash;so tiny that you could
scarce see it; but it was the same story over again&mdash;the bannock was
too big.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said Gertrude, 'I can't give you anything; you must just
go without, for all these bannocks are too big.'</p>

<p>"Then our Lord waxeth wroth, and said. 'Since you loved me so
little as to grudge me a morsel of food, you shall have this punishment&mdash;you
shall become a bird and seek your food between bark and
bole, and never get a drop to drink save when it rains.'</p>

<p>"He had scarce said the last word before she was turned into
a great black woodpecker, or Gertrude's bird, and flew from her
kneading trough right up the chimney; and till this very day you
may see her flying about, with her red mutch on her head, and her
body all black, because of the soot in the chimney; and so she hacks
and taps away at the trees for her food, and whistles when rain is
coming, for she is ever athirst, and then she looks for a drop to cool
her tongue."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Brand informs us that "the woodpecker's cry denotes wet."</p>

<p>Grimm tells a German version of the story, in which the hard-hearted
baker is a man, but whose wife and six daughters were made
of more charitable materials. They privately bestowed what he had
publicly refused, and were rewarded by being converted into the
"seven stars" (the Pleiades), while the baker was transformed into a
cuckoo. The cuckoo is believed to continue his spring cry only so
long as the "seven stars" are visible in the heavens. Another version
says the cuckoo was a baker's or miller's man. He cheated the poor,
and "when the dough swelled by God's blessing in the oven, he drew
it out and nipped off a portion of it, crying each time 'gukuk,'
which signifies 'look! look!' For this crime he was converted into
a cuckoo, and condemned to the perpetual repetition of the monotonous
cry."</p>

<p>A Lancashire superstition exists referred to in Chapter IX., in
which the plover is identified as the transmuted soul of a Jew. At
least, when seven of them are seen together, they are called the
"seven whistlers," and their musical chorus bodes ill or harm to
those who hear it. The tradition represents them as the "souls of
those Jews who assisted at the crucifixion, and in consequence were
doomed to float in the air for ever."</p>

<p>Wordsworth, in his beautiful poem, "The White Doe of Rylstone,"
has preserved the memory of a Yorkshire tradition which asserts that
the soul of the lady founder of Bolton Abbey revisited the ruins of
the venerable pile, in the form of a spotless white doe.</p>

<p>The Manx wren, the robin, and the stork are supposed to be inhabited
by the souls of human beings. MacTaggart, speaking of the
wren, says,&mdash;"Manx herring fishers dare not go to sea without one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of these birds taken dead with them, for fear of disasters and storms.
Their tradition is of a <i>sea spirit</i> that hunted the <i>herring track</i>,
attended always by storms, and at last it assumed the figure of a
wren and flew away. So they think that when they have a dead
wren with them all is snug. The poor bird had a sad life of it in
that singular island. When one is seen at any time, scores of Manxmen
start and hunt it down." The stork in Prussia, on the contrary,
is protected from injury, owing to the belief that "he is elsewhere a
man." Gervase of Tilbury informs us that in England it was regarded
as both bird and man. It was a very wide-spread belief that
the human soul left its earthly tabernacle in the form of a bird. The
"Milky-way" is, in Finland and Lithuania, the "Birds' way," or the
"Way of Souls." Grimm tells us that every member of a certain
Polish noble family are turned into eagles at death. He adds the
eldest daughter of the Pileck line, if they die unmarried, are transformed
into doves, but, if married, into owls. Kelly relates an anecdote
of a gentleman in Soho, London, who believed that the departing soul
of his brother-in-law, in the form of a bird, tapped at his window at
the time of his death. The mother and sister, in Grimm's story of "The
White and the Black Bride," push the true bride into the stream.
At the same or the following moment a snow-white swan is discovered
swimming gracefully down the river.</p>

<p>M. Paul B. Du Chaillu, in his recent work, "A Journey to Ashango-land;
and further penetration into Equatorial Africa," gives
two curious illustrations of the existence of a belief in men being
sometimes transformed into beasts. He says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot avoid relating in this place a very curious instance of
a strange and horrid form of monomania which is sometimes displayed
by these primitive negroes. It was related to me so circumstantially
by Akondogo, and so well confirmed by others, that I
cannot help fully believing in all the principal facts of the case. Poor
Akondogo said that he had had plenty of trouble in his day, that a
leopard had killed two of his men, and that he had a great many
palavers to settle on account of these deaths. Not knowing exactly
what he meant, I said to him, 'Why did you not make a trap to catch
the leopard?' To my astonishment, he replied, 'The leopard was
not of the kind you mean. It was a man who had changed himself
into a leopard, and then became a man again.' I said, 'Akondogo,
I will never believe your story. How can a man be turned into a
leopard?' He again asserted that it was true, and gave me the following
history:&mdash;'Whilst he was in the woods with his people, gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
india-rubber, one of his men disappeared, and, notwithstanding all
their endeavours, nothing could be found of him but a quantity of
blood. The next day another man disappeared, and in searching for
him more blood was found. All the people got alarmed, and Akondogo
sent for a great doctor to drink the mboundou, and solve the mystery
of these two deaths. To the horror and astonishment of the old
chief, the doctor declared it was Akondogo's own child (his nephew
and heir), Akosho, who had killed the two men. Akosho was sent
for, and, when asked by the chief, answered that it was truly he who
had committed the murders; that he could not help it, for he had
been turned into a leopard, and his heart longed for blood; and that
after each deed he had turned into a man again. Akondogo loved
his boy so much that he would not believe his own confession, until
the boy took him to a place in the forest where lay the two bodies,
one with the head cut off, and the other with the belly torn open.
Upon this, Akondogo gave orders to seize the lad. He was bound
with ropes, taken to the village, and then tied in a horizontal position
to a post, and burnt slowly to death, all the people standing by until
he expired.'</p>

<p>"I must say the end of the story seemed to me too horrible to
listen to. I shuddered, and was ready to curse the race that was
capable of committing such acts. But on careful enquiry, I found it
was a case of monomania with the boy Akosho, and that he really
was the murderer of the two men. It is probable that the superstitious
belief of these morbidly imaginative Africans in the transformation
of men into leopards, being early instilled into the minds of
their children, is the direct cause of murders being committed under
the influence of it. The boy himself, as well as Akondogo and all
the people, believed he had really turned into a leopard, and the cruel
punishment was partly in vengeance for witchcraft, and partly to
prevent the committal of more crimes by the boy in a similar way,
for, say they, the man has a spirit of witchcraft."</p>

<p>Again, after informing us that the Ashango people believed
(not knowing that he was really wounded in his disastrous retreat
from their country), that he, being "Oguisi," or "the spirit," was
invulnerable, and that their poisoned arrows glanced from his body
without doing him any injury, he further adds, that Magouga, one
of his native guides, said "he had heard that at one time I had
turned myself into a leopard, had hid myself in a tree, and had
sprung upon the Mouaou people as they came to make war upon my
men; that at other times I turned myself into a gorilla, or into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
an elephant, and struck terror and death among the Mouaou and
Mobana. Magouga finished his story by asking me for a 'war fetich,'
for he said I must possess the art of making fetiches, or I and my
men could not have escaped so miraculously."</p>

<p>It is necessary to remind the reader that Du Chaillu and others
have failed to find any remains of ancient civilisation on the western
coast of Equatorial Africa, and that he expressly states his belief in
the native tradition that the ancestors of the present tribes migrated
from the east.</p>

<p>The Rev. G. W. Cox, in his "Mythology of the Aryan Nations,"
referring to the origin of Greek "Lykanthropy," says,&mdash;"The question
to be answered is, whence came the notions that men were changed
into wolves, bears, and birds, and not into lions, fishes, or reptiles;
and to this question Comparative Mythology seems to me to furnish
a complete answer; nor can I disavow my belief that this loathsome
vampire superstition was in the first instance purely the result of a
verbal equivocation which, as we have seen, has furnished so fruitful
a source of myths." Mr. Cox regards the superstition to have
originated in "that confusion between Leukos bright, as a general
epithet, and the same word Lukos as a special name for the wolf,
from which sprung first the myth of the transformation of Lycaon,
and then probably the wide-spread superstition of Lykanthropy."</p>

<p>Respecting the Eastern origin of this superstition, Kelly says,&mdash;"The
were-wolf tradition has not been discovered with certainty
amongst the Hindoos, but there is no European nation of Aryan
descent in which it has not existed from time immemorial. Hence,
it is certain that the tradition itself, or the germs of it more or less
developed, must have been brought by them all from Arya; and if
Dr. Schwartz has not actually proved his case, he seems at least to
have conjectured rightly in assigning, as one of these germs, the
Aryan conception of the howling wind as a wolf. The Maruts and
other beings who were busy in the storm assumed various shapes.
The human form was proper to many or all of them, for they were
identical with the Pitris or Fathers, and it would have been a very
natural thought, when a storm broke out suddenly, that one or more
of these people of the air had turned into wolves for the occasion.
It was also a prim&aelig;val notion that there were dogs and wolves
amongst the dwellers in hell; and Weber, who has shown that this
belief was entertained by the early Hindoos, is of opinion that these
infernal animals were real were-wolves, that is to say, men upon
whom such a transformation had been inflicted as a punishment."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The darkness of night is personified by the wolf in the folk-lore of
the Teutonic nations. It is the Fenris of the Edda. In this sense
the mythic wolf and "Little Red Riding Hood" are transparent enough.
The ruddy glow of the evening sunlight is extinguished in the darkness
of night. The Rev. G. W. Cox says that in one version of the
story "Little Red Cap escapes his malice as Memnon rises again
from Hades." This resurrection typifies the dawn springing from
the darkness of the night on the following morning.</p>

<p>The Greek myth developed into the story that Zeus, when visiting
Lycaon, was fed by his numerous sons with human flesh, and that
he, in his anger at such treatment, turned them all into wolves.
Similar transformations are frequent in the classical myths. Kirke
turned the followers of Odysseus into swine, and Callisto was turned
into a bear by the anger of Artemis.</p>

<p>This were-wolf, or man-wolf, myth, from the Anglo-Saxon <i>wer</i>, a
man, has doubtless undergone much change and mutilation in its
descent to modern times. The earlier Apollo of the Greeks, at the
time of Homer even, was not the Sun-god he afterwards became.
He was the "god of the summer storms," and, as such, he himself
appeared in the form of a wolf. His mother, Latona, as Kelly observes,
was regarded as "the dark storm-cloud, escorted at Jove's command
by the Northwind," and she "came as a she-wolf from Lycia to the
place where she was delivered of her twins.... In mythical
language, Apollo was the son of Zeus; that is to say, he was Zeus
in another form. The two gods were, in fact, like Indra and Rudra,
only different personifications of the same cycle of natural phenomena."</p>

<p>The Laureate, in his recent poem, "The Coming of Arthur," has
the following beautiful poetic illustration of that which, no doubt,
underlies much of the were-wolf superstitions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,<br /></span>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the various lightning birds of the Aryan mythology, some
were regarded as portentous of evil; others, as the robin, the stork, and
the woodpecker, on the contrary, were regarded with favour, and
especially protected. The red breast of the robin, the red legs of the
stork, and the red mutch of the woodpecker, were believed to result
from their lightning origin. In Germany the robin is held in as much
regard as it is in England. The Anglo-Saxon name, <i>Hrodhbeorht</i>, or
<i>Hrodhbriht</i>, signifies flamebright, which was one of the appellations
of Thor. In illustration of the reverence paid to the redbreast, a
writer in "Notes and Queries" relates the following beautiful story,
which he had from his nurse, a native of C&aelig;rmarthenshire:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Far, far away, is a land of woe, darkness, spirits of evil, and <i>fire</i>.
Day by day does the little bird bear in his bill a drop of water to
quench the flame. So near to the burning stream does he fly, that
his dear little feathers are scorched; and hence he is named <i>Bronrhuddyn</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, breast-burned, or breast-scorched). To serve little
children, the robin dares approach the infernal pit. No good child
will hurt the devoted benefactor of man. The robin returns from the
land of fire, and therefore he feels the cold of winter far more than
his brother birds. He shivers in the brumal blast; hungry he chirps
before your door. Oh! my child, then, in gratitude throw a few
crumbs to poor redbreast."</p>

<p>I have not to this day forgotten the sense of shame and sorrow with
which I was overwhelmed, when, as a boy, being permitted for the
first time to discharge a fowling-piece at a small bird in a shrubbery,
I discovered that the feathered songster whose life I had taken was a
robin-redbreast.</p>

<p>The stork is, in Germany especially, ever a welcome guest, and
wheels (sun emblems) are placed on the roofs of houses in Hesse, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
order to encourage the storks to build their nests thereupon. Their
presence is supposed to render the building safe against the ravages
of fire. Mannhardt mentions an instance in which, to avenge the
abstraction of her young, it is said a stork carried a flaming brand
in her beak, threw it into the nest, and thus set the house on fire.
The German name for stork, Grimm says, is literally child or soul-bringer.
Hence the belief that the advent of infants is presided
over by this bird, which obtains so largely in Denmark and Germany.</p>

<p>Amongst the remains of birds and animals consumed as food by
the framers of the Danish "kj&ouml;kkenm&ouml;ddings," or shell-mounds, the
absence of the bones of the domestic fowl, two species of swallow,
the sparrow and the stork, has been commented upon by several
arch&aelig;ologists. This is attributable, doubtless, to the sacred character
with which they were invested by the inhabitants of the district when
the said mounds were formed. For a similar reason, as has been
previously observed, no bones of the hare have been found in these
ancient "kitchen-middens."</p>

<p>Amongst the birds of evil omen, the owl appears to rank with
the foremost. Bourne says, "If an owl, which is reckoned a most
abominable and unlucky bird, send forth its hoarse and dismal voice, it
is an omen of the approach of some terrible thing; that some dire
calamity and some great misfortune is near at hand." Chaucer
speaks of the "owl eke that of deth the bode bringeth." Amongst the
Romans its appearance was regarded as a most certain portent of death.
In the year 312, on the day on which Constantine saw the vision of the
cross in the heavens, with the legend "In hoc signo vinces," Zosimus,
the pagan historian, informs us that his opponent, Maxentius, was
disconcerted by the adverse portent of a flight of owls. Speaking of
the prodigies which were said to accompany the passing away of
Augustus C&aelig;sar, Xiphilinus says that an "owl sung on the top of the
Curia." Our Elizabethan and later poets often refer to this superstition.
In one of Reed's old plays we have:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">

<p class="noin">Spencer speaks of "the ill-fac'd owl, death's dreadful messenger,"
and Pennant, when describing what is called the tawny owl, says,

<p>In the Greek mythology the owl was the symbol of Athen&ecirc;. Hence, as
before observed, she was styled "Glaucopis," or owl-eyed. According to
Payne Knight, this symbol was adopted for the wise goddess because
the owl was "a bird which seems to surpass all other creatures in
acuteness of organic perception, its eye being calculated to observe
objects which to all others are enveloped in darkness, its ear to hear
sounds distinctly, and its nostrils to discriminate effluvia with such
nicety that it has been deemed prophetic, from discovering the putridity
of death even in the first stages of disease." As in the case of
the dog, referred to in Chapter IX., it is by no means improbable
that the extremely delicate sense of smell possessed by the owl, lies at
the root of this superstition. Its after development into a prophetic
power respecting approaching death, even without previous disease,
can easily be understood, after the original physical conditions had
entered into the mythical realm of legend and superstition.</p>

<p>The cuckoo is generally regarded, like the owl and the raven, as a
bird of ill omen. According to Mannhardt, on first hearing its note,
the German peasant rolls himself on the grass, as he does when he
hears thunder. The observance of this ceremony is supposed to
insure to the individual freedom from aches and pains during the
year. It is considered to be unlucky to hear the cuckoo for the first
time without coin in the pocket. The more fortunate peasants yet
instinctively turn over their money to insure "luck" on first hearing
this bird's cry.</p>

<p>The old English rhyme is well known in Lancashire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cuckoo, cherry tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good bird tell me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many years have I to live.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In some places there is a triple rhyme, the last line reading thus:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How many years before I dee? (die).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I remember well indulging in my youth, with other boys, in the
divination described by Sir Henry Ellis, as follows:&mdash;"Easy to
foretel what sort of summer it would be by the position in which
the larva of <i>Cic&agrave;da (Aphrophora) spumaria</i> was found to lie in
the froth (<i>cuckoo-spit</i>) in which it is enveloped. If the insect lay with
its head upwards, it infallibly denoted a dry summer; if downwards,
a wet one." The said spume was fully believed to have been deposited
upon the vegetation by the expectoration of the cuckoo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Cuckoos are believed to become sparrowhawks in winter. The Rev.
H. B. Fristram, at a recent meeting of the British Association, held
at Newcastle-on-Tyne, stated when he once remonstrated with a man
for shooting a cuckoo, "the defence was that it was well known that
<i>sparrowhawkes turned into cuckoos</i> in the summer." Grimm states that
in Germany, after St. John's day, about the time when it becomes
mute, the cuckoo is believed to change into a hawk. Referring to
these facts, Kelly pertinently asks, as "the form of the cuckoo
remotely resembles that of the falcon tribe, may we hazard a conjecture
that hence, in German tradition, that bird in some degree
represents the fire-bringing falcon of the Aryans?" Mannhardt says,
"The cuckoo is the messenger of Thor, the god in whose gift were
health and strength, length of days, and marriage blessings, and
therefore it is that people call upon the bird to tell how long they
have to live, how soon they will be married, and how many children
they shall have; and that in Schaumberg the person who acts at a
wedding as master of the ceremonies carries a cuckoo on his staff."</p>

<p>Kelly says:&mdash;"The cuckoo's connection with storms and tempests
is not clearly determined, but the owl's is indisputable. Its cry is
believed in England to foretell rain and hail, the latter of which is
usually accompanied with lightning, and the practice of nailing it to
the barn door, to avert the lightning, is common throughout Europe,
and is mentioned by Palladius in his treatise on agriculture."</p>

<p>The wren, as I have shown in a previous chapter, is mercilessly
hunted to death in the Isle of Man, although he partakes of the
sanctity of the robin in most parts of England. Not so in Ireland,
however. General Vallancy says:&mdash;"The Druids represented this as
the king of all birds. The superstitious respect shown to this little
bird gave offence to our first Christian missionaries, and by their commands
he is still hunted and killed on Christmas-day; and on the
following (St. Stephen's-day) he is carried about hung by the leg in
the centre of two hoops crossing each other at right angles, and a
procession is made in every village, of men, women, and children,
singing an Irish catch importing him to be the king of all birds."</p>

<p>The wren is sometimes treated in a similar manner in the south of
France. It is generally, however, regarded as a sacred bird, as in
England and Scotland. To take its life or to rob its nest even, in
the Pays de Caux, is regarded as a crime of such atrocity that it
will "<i>bring down the lightning</i>" upon the homestead of the offender.
Robert Chambers, in his "Popular Rhymes," has the following
couplet on this subject:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">That harry the Ladye of Heaven's hen!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">It would seem from these facts that the poor little bird has met with
a somewhat similar fate to that of Odin and the rest of the &AElig;sir
gods, and has been transformed, occasionally at least, into a spirit
of evil.</p>

<p>In Perigord, according to De Nore, the swallow is called "<i>La Poule
de Dieu</i>" and is regarded as "the messenger of life." The cricket,
too, is held in similar estimation. May not the latter have acquired
its reputation from its fondness of the domestic hearth, and its presumed
immunity from the effects of fire?</p>

<p>The raven, sacred to Odin and Apollo, the German and Greek
forms of the Aryan Rudra, was, and indeed is yet, pre-eminently the
bird of ill-omen. Lady Macbeth, in the fulness of her murderous
impulse, exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan<br /></span>

<p class="noin">And, again, Othello says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">As doth the raven o'er the infected house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boding to all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">All know what powerful use Edgar Allan Poe has made of this "grim,
ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore," in his marvellous
poem, "The Raven."</p>

<p>The raven's power of scenting carrion from a great distance may
have originally influenced, as in the case of the dog and owl, its
selection as a personification of impending death or other calamity.</p>

<p>The raven was the standard of the Scandinavian vikingrs, as the
eagle was of the Ancient Romans, and is of the French of the present
day. Asser, in his "Life of Alfred the Great," when describing a
victory gained by that king near Kynwith Castle says: "they gained
a very large booty, and among other things the standard called
Raven; for they say that the three sisters of Hindwai and Hubba,
daughters of Lodobroch, wove that flag and got it ready in one day.
They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever that flag went
before them, if they were to gain the victory, a live crow would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
appear flying in the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to
be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved
to be so." Doubtless much of the still lingering aversion for crows,
ravens, and magpies, is but the remains of the dislike of our Anglo-Saxon
ancestors to the emblem of their once dreaded mortal enemies,
or it is, perhaps, more probable that each people had preserved a
similar traditionary faith in the supernatural character of the bird
from their common remote ancestors. Indeed, reference is made to
the raven as a war emblem in the fragment of heroic Anglo-Saxon
poetry, containing part of a description of the battle at Finnesburg,
which was found on the cover of a MS. of homilies, in the library at
Lambeth Palace, by Dr. Hicks, in the sixteenth century. On the
defeat of the warriors, the MS. says,&mdash;"The raven wandered, swart
and sallow brown." There is, as I have previously observed,
in Chapter IX., a tradition in Cornwall that King Arthur is yet alive
in the form of a raven, and superstitious persons yet refuse to kill the
bird from a belief in its truth.</p>

<p>Many other birds possess somewhat similar attributes to the raven,
such as crows, magpies, jackdaws, &amp;c. Ramesey (Elminthologia,
1668) says:&mdash;"If a crow fly but over the house and croak thrice,
how do they fear, they, or some one else in the family, shall die."
The croaking of crows and ravens foreboded rain. In this particular
they resembled the woodpecker. It was, nay, it is yet held that to
see a crow on the left hand is a sinister omen. In the "Defensative
against the Poyson of supposed Prophesies," by the Earl of Northampton,
published in 1583, we find the following:&mdash;"The flight of
many crowes upon the left side of the campe made the Romans very
much afrayde of some badde lucke; as if the greate god Jupiter had
nothing else to do (said Carneades) but to drive jack-dawes in a flock
together."</p>

<p>The evil boding of the "seven whistlers," or flock of plovers, in
Lancashire, has been previously referred to. In Lancashire and
the north of England magpies are termed pyanots. The old
formula, which attributes certain results as the consequence of
their appearance, is still firmly believed in, viz.:&mdash;"One for sorrow,
two for mirth, three for a wedding and four for death."
Intelligent persons, yet, from mere habit, on the sight of a magpie,
involuntary turn round three times, or mark a cross with the
toe on the ground, in order to avert the calamity supposed to be
attendant upon its untoward presence. The original name, when
fully expressed, appears to have been maggott pie. Shakspere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
mentions it under this designation, when, in Macbeth, he refers to
its use in divination. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Augurs and understood relations have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By maggot pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret'st man of blood.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The woodpecker, perhaps, of all the fire-bringing birds, has most
permeated the ancient mythologies. The Latins named it Picus,
whose brother (or double), Pilumnus, was the god of bakers and
millers. In early times the millers pounded their corn with a pestle,
and <i>pilum</i> signified both pestle and javelin, which are equally types
of the thunderbolt. The tapping of the beak of the woodpecker was
regarded as partaking of a similar character. On the birth of a child
it was customary at Rome to prepare a couch for Pilumnus and
Picumnus, who were believed to bring the fire of life, and were supposed
to remain until the vitality of the infant was indisputable.
The Romans likewise styled the woodpecker Martus and Feronius,
from the god Mars and the Sabine goddess Feronia. The name
Feronia is indicative of fire or soul bringing, and is intimately connected
with that of Phoroneus, the Prometheus of a Peloponnesian
legend, relating to the original procuration of the heavenly fire. Dr.
Kuhn says both names are identical with the epithet commonly
applied to the Aryan fire-god Agni, <i>Churanyu</i>, which signifies "one
who pounces down, or bears down rapidly."</p>

<p>Picus was the son of Saturn, and the first King of Latium, as well
as a fire-bringing bird. This, Kelly observes, "is only another way
of saying that he, too, like Manu, Minyas, Minos, Phoroneus, and
other fire-bringers, is the first man; and therefore it is that, under
the name of Picumnus, he continued in latter times to be the guardian
genius of children, along with his brother Pilumnus."</p>

<p>A remarkable coincidence between the Anglo-Saxon pedigree of
Odin, which makes Beav, or Beovolf, one of his ancestors, and the
story of the first King of Latium, is noticed by Grimm. Beewolf&mdash;that
is, bee-eater&mdash;is the German name for the woodpecker.</p>

<p>Many other birds were believed to forecast the weather, such as the
barn door fowl, the stormy petrel, the heron, and the crane, all of which
appear but to be modifications of the Aryan lightning birds so often
referred to. In the Greek version of the myth, the raven represents
the dark cloud. Originally, however, the cloud referred to was
white; but Apollo, having sent his favourite bird to the fountain for
water, was imposed upon by the feathered idler and glutton; he,
therefore, turned his plumage black, and condemned him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
punishment to a continuous croaking for water to quench his thirst.</p>

<p>Amongst insects, the lady-bird appears to have been a fire-bringer,
and is yet much in vogue in matters of augury. Gay says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This lady-fly I take from off the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose spotted back might scarlet red surpass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly lady-bird, north, south, or east or west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly where the man is found that I love best.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">I know not whether the dandelion can be classed among the lightning
plants, but I remember well the blowing away of its ripened
winged seeds with the view to ascertain the time of the day, as well
as to solve much more profound mysteries.</p>

<p>In the "Athenian Oracle" the following curious rejoinder appears
to the query:&mdash;"Why rats, toads, ravens, screech owls, are ominous;
and how they came to foreknow fatal events?" The writer replies:
"Had the querist said unlucky instead of ominous he might easily
have met with satisfaction; a rat is so because it destroys many a
Cheshire cheese, &amp;c. A toad is unlucky because it poisons." [This
is now known to be erroneous.] "As for ravens and screech owls,
they are just as unlucky as cats, when about their courtship, because
they make an ugly noise, which disturbes their neighbourhood. The
instinct of rats leaving an old ship is because they cannot be dry in
it, and an old house because, perhaps, they want victuals. A raven
is much such a prophet as our conjurors or almanac makers, foretelling
events after they are come to pass: they follow great armies,
as vultures, not as foreboding battle, but for the dead men, dogs,
horses, &amp;c., which, especially in a march, must be daily left behind
them. But the foolish observations made on their croaking before
death, etc., are for the most part pure humour, and have no grounds
besides foolish tradition or a sickly imagination." Old Reginald Scot,
as early as the sixteenth century, stoutly contended "that to prognosticate
that guests approach to your house on the chattering of
pies or haggisters, [a Kentish term for magpie,] is altogether vanity
and superstition."</p>

<p>The <i>Shipping Gazette</i>, in April, 1869, contained a communication
entitled "A Sailor's Notion about Rats," in which the following passage
occurs:&mdash;"It is a well authenticated fact that rats have often been
known to leave ships in the harbour previous to their being lost at
sea. Some of those wiseacres who want to convince us <i>against the
evidence of our senses</i> will call this superstition. As neither I have
time, nor you space, to cavil with such at present, I shall leave them
alone in their glory." It is difficult to decide whether the superstition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the bad logic, or the self-sufficiency of the writer of this
sentence most predominates. It is a pity he did not edify the
"wiseacres" as to how "the evidence of our senses" could by any
possibility bring us in contact with the motive of rats, with whom
we have had no intercourse either of a mental or moral kind. But
perhaps the said "Shipmaster" has, after taking rats into his council,
rejected their advice, and lost his bark in consequence. Truly it is a
difficult matter to determine where abject superstition ends and ordinary
credulity begins. The fact that rats do sometimes migrate
from one ship to another, or from one barn or corn stack to another,
from various causes, ought to be quite sufficient to explain such
"evidence of our senses" as informs us that "rats have often been
known to leave ships in harbour <i>previous</i> to their being lost at sea."
If they left the ship at all <i>in harbour</i>, it, of necessity must have
been <i>before</i> the vessel was lost at sea. The error lies in the
assertion, without the slightest "evidence of our senses" to support
it, that sailor rats are genuine Zadkiels, and can peep into futurity
by the aid of some supernatural power denied to mariners of the
genus <i>homo</i>.</p>

<p>This superstition, nevertheless, is evidently one of considerable
antiquity. Shakspere refers to it in the Tempest. Prospero, describing
the vessel in which himself and daughter had been placed
with the view to their certain destruction at sea says:&mdash;</p>

</div><div class="rgt"><i>S. Sheppard, 1651.</i></div></div>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">Faith</span> in the power of the "wish" or "divining rod" is by no
means extinct in the North of England. In modern times it is chiefly
believed to be potent in the detection of metallic veins, hidden
treasure, or subterranean springs of water. Our ancestors, however,
held that this mystic instrument was endowed with the faculty of
bringing "luck" or good fortune to its possessor, and of causing his
slightest wish or desire to receive fulfilment. I have a faint recollection
of a story relative to the use of the divining rod, with the view
to ascertain the locality of the "buried treasure," since discovered,
in the valley of the Ribble, near Preston, and now known as the
celebrated "Cuerdale hoard." This treasure, in all human probability,
was consigned to the earth immediately after the famous battle
of Brunanburh, in the earlier portion of the tenth century. Although
it remained undisturbed about nine hundred years, a tradition survived,
which asserted that the place of the deposit could be seen from
the promontory overlooking the valley on which Walton, or "Law,"
Church is situated. The late Mr. B. F. Allen, of Preston, remembered
a farmer ploughing deeply the whole of an extensive field in
the neighbourhood, in the hope of discovering the long-lost treasure,
some professor of the art of divination by the "wish-rod" having
pronounced in favour of the probability of a successful result. Singularly
enough, even after the accidental discovery of the treasure
chest of the days of Athelstan, the country people of the neighbourhood
still nursed the memory of the tradition with great fondness,
firmly believing that the "find" referred to was but a foretaste of
what was to come. I was forcibly struck with the tenacity of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
species of tradition, when engaged digging on the site of the Roman
station at the junction of the Darwen and the Ribble, in 1855. The
turning up of a few scattered brass coins of the higher empire, led to
a rumour that we had come upon "th' buried goud" at last, and caused
us some inconvenience. The Cuerdale hoard, it must be remembered,
consisted entirely of coins, marks, and bracelets and other ornaments
<i>in silver</i>. Mr. Martland, who farmed the land at the time, told me
some curious stories respecting this mound at Walton-le-Dale, which
would indicate that treasure-seekers had been more than once practising
their vocation in the neighbourhood. Some thirteen or fourteen
years previously, a hole nine or ten feet long was dug in one
night by some unknown persons. A silver coin (most probably
Roman) was found on the filling up of the trench. Mr. Martland
likewise remembered hearing of a somewhat similar hole having been
excavated between forty or fifty years previously, under equally mysterious
circumstances, and not far from the same spot. The locality
was watched every evening for a fortnight, before the hole was filled
up, with the view to ascertain whether the midnight excavators would
resume their labours. Nothing was discovered which either identified
the parties or explained their object. The general impression, however,
was that they were treasure hunters, and that they had acted
under some magical or supernatural direction.</p>

<p>In a manuscript of the early part of the seventeenth century, by
John Bell, the necessary formul&aelig; for the procuration and preparation
of the divining rod are thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you find in the wood or elsewhere, on old walls or on high
hills or rocks, a rowan which has grown out of a berry let fall from a
bird's bill, you must go at twilight in the evening of the third day
after our Lady's day, and either uproot or break off the said rod or
tree; but you must take care that neither iron or steel come nigh it,
and that it do not fall to the ground on the way home. Then place
the rod under the roof, at a spot under which you have laid sundry
metals, and in a short time you will see with astonishment how the
rod gradually bends under the roof towards the metals. When the
rod has remained fourteen days or more in the same place, you take
a knife or an awl which has been stroked with a magnet, and previously
stuck through a great Fr&ouml;groda (?), slit the bark on all sides,
and pour or drop in cock's blood, especially such as is drawn from
the comb of a cock of one colour; and when this blood has dried the
rod is ready, and gives manifest proof of the efficacy of its wondrous
nature."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The same writer referring to the subject of rabdomanteia or rod
divination, relates the following, on the authority of Theophylact:&mdash;"They
set up two staffs, and having whispered some verses and incantations,
the staffs fell by the operations of d&aelig;mons. Then they considered
which way each of them fell, forward or backward, to the right
or left hand, and agreeably gave responses, having made use of the
fall of their staffs for their signs."</p>

<p>This superstition appears to have been very prevalent in the
earliest times. The divination of the Chaldeans has passed into a
proverb. Ezekiel refers to it, and Hosea denounces the Jews for
their faith in such heathen ceremonies. He exclaims&mdash;"My people
ask counsel at their stocks, and <i>their staff</i> declareth unto them." It
was practised by the Alani, according to Herodotus, and we have the
authority of Tacitus for the estimation in which it was held by the
ancient Germanic tribes.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Ellis refers to an effort by miners to discover a metallic
lode, by means of the divining rod, as recently as 1842. He thus
describes the experiment:&mdash;"The method of procedure was to cut the
twig of a hazel or an apple tree, of twelvemonths' growth, into a forked
shape, and to hold this by both hands in a peculiar way, walking
across the land until the twig bent, which was taken as an indication
of the locality of a lode. The person who generally practices this
divination boasts himself to be the seventh son of a seventh son. The
twig of hazel bends in his hands to the conviction of the miners that
ore is present; but then the peculiar manner in which the twig is held,
bringing muscular action to bear upon it, accounts for its gradual
deflection, and the circumstance of the strata walked over always
containing ore, gives a further credit to the process of divination."</p>

<p>The following curious anecdote, referring to this subject, appears
in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1752:&mdash;"M. Linn&aelig;us, when he was
upon his voyage to Scania, hearing his secretary highly extol the
virtues of his divining wand, was willing to convince him of its insufficiency,
and for that purpose concealed a purse of one hundred
ducats under a ranunculus which grew by itself in a meadow, and bid
the secretary find it if he could. The wand discovered nothing, and
M. Linn&aelig;us's mark was soon trampled down by the company who were
present; so that when M. Linn&aelig;us went to finish the experiment by
fetching the gold himself, he was utterly at a loss where to seek it.
The man with the wand assisted him, and pronounced it could not
lie the way they were going, but quite the contrary, so pursued the
direction of his wand, and actually dug out the gold. M. Linn&aelig;us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
adds that such another experiment would be sufficient to make a
proselyte of him." Lilly relates an effort of his to discover hidden
treasure by the divining rod. He, however, frankly confesses that he
failed in his object.</p>

<p>The divining rod in form resembled the letter Y, and, independently
of its other magical qualities, owed some of its supposed power
to its form and the number of its limbs. The peculiar and regular
equiangular form of the branches of the mistletoe, doubtless, had much
influence in its selection as a mystical plant endowed with supernatural
properties. The number three, and its multiple nine, together
with the mystic Abracadabra, the double triangle of the Gnostics,
have been regarded from the most remote ages as of mystical import.
The association of the "seventh son of a seventh son" (another
mystic number) with the procedure, is likewise indicative of a mathematical
element at the root of this superstition.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, in his "Juventus Mundi," says,&mdash;"With respect
to the Trident" (of Poseidon or Neptune), "an instrument so unsuited
to water, it appears evidently to point to some tradition of a Trinity,
such as may still be found in various forms of Eastern religion, other
than the Hebrew. It may have proceeded, among the Ph&#339;nicians,
from the common source of an older tradition; and this seems more
probable than its direct derivation from the Hebrews, with whom,
however, we know that the Ph&#339;nicians had intercourse."</p>

<p>The horseshoe, which is so frequently seen nailed to stable and
shippon doors, as a charm against the machinations of witches, is
said to owe its virtue chiefly to its shape. Any other object presenting
two points or forks, even the spreading out of the two fore-fingers,
is said to possess similar occult power, though not in so high a degree
as the rowan wish-rod. In Spain and Italy forked pieces of coral are
in high repute as witch scarers. A crescent formed of two boar's
tusks is frequently appended to the necks of mules, to protect the
animals from witchcraft. The boar's tusk I have previously shown
to be an Aryan lightning emblem.</p>

<p>Kelly is of opinion that the mandrake, on account of its form and
supposed lightning origin, possessed, in common with the wish-rod, the
power of conferring good fortune on its possessor. The root of the
mandrake is believed to bear some resemblance to a human being,
and appears to have been used in England by sorcerers as an image
of the victim operated upon, as well as figures made of clay or wax.
In his "Art of Simpling," Coles says that witches "take likewise the
roots of the mandrake, according to some, or, as I rather suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
<i>the roots of briony</i>, which simple folke take for the true mandrake,
and make thereof an ugly image, by which they represent the person
on whom they intend to exercise their witchcraft." He adds&mdash;"Some
plants have roots with a number of threads, like beards, as
mandrakes, whereof witches and imposters make an ugly image,
giving it the form of a face at the top of the root, and leave those
strings to make a broad beard down to the feet." Dr. Kuhn and others
are of opinion that the form of the wish-rod originated in a somewhat
similar idea; or rather that the two superstitions had, in this respect,
a common origin. It appears that these rods are yet dressed like
dolls in some parts of Germany, and that they are occasionally
attached to the body of a child about to be christened. Sch&ouml;nwerth
informs us that in the Oberpfalz the newly-cut wish-rod is formally
baptised, and the sign of the cross made over it three times by the
operator. Kelly adds&mdash;"This is not all. In every instance the
divining or wish-rod has a forked end. This is an essential point,
as all authorities agree in declaring. Now a forked rod (or a 'forked
raddish') is the simplest possible image of the human figure."</p>

<p>The English mandrake, used by witches and treasure hunters, is,
as Coles observes, the <i>briony</i>, the veritable <i>atropa mandragora</i> not
being found in the northern portion of the continent of Europe. It
flourishes luxuriantly in the Grecian islands. Mr. John Ingram, in
his "Flora Symbolica," says the mandragora is "the emblem of
<i>rarity</i>." He adds,&mdash;"Amongst the Oriental races the mandrake,
probably on account of its f&#339;tid odour and venomous properties, is
regarded with intense abhorrence; the Arabs, Richardson says, call
it 'the devil's candle,' because of its shiny appearance in the night;
a circumstance thus alluded to by Moore in his 'Lalla Rookh':&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such rank and deadly lustre dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in those hellish fires that light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mandrake's charmed leaves at night.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There is an old, deeply-rooted superstition connected with this
ominous plant, which we have reason to believe is not yet altogether
eradicated from the minds of the uneducated, that the mandrake
grows up under the gallows, being nourished by the exhalations from
executed criminals; and that when it is pulled out of the ground it
utters lamentable cries, as if possessed of sensibility:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The phantom shapes&mdash;oh, touch them not&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That appal the murderer's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lurk in the fleshy mandrake's stem,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That shrieks when pluck'd at night.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>So says Moore in verse, only repeating what many have said gravely
in prose.</p>

<p>"Another terrible quality imputed to this wretched plant was that
the person pulling it out of the ground would be seriously injured by
its pestilential effects, some even averring that death speedily resulted
from them; in order therefore to guard against this danger, the surrounding
soil was removed, and the plant fastened securely to a dog,
so that when the animal was driven away he drew up the root, and
paid the penalty of the deed."</p>

<p>Dr. Kuhn contends that this human form was given to the mandrake
and the wish-rod because both were believed to be of divine or
supernatural origin, and represented a species of demi-god, of the
lightning tribe. Kelly contends that "a comparison with ancient
Hindoo usages fully confirms the truth of this conclusion. The
human form is expressly attributed in the Rig Veda and other
Sanscrit books to the pieces of asvattha wood used for kindling sacred
fire&mdash;so many inches for the head and neck, so many for the upper
and lower parts of the trunk, the thighs and legs respectively&mdash;and
the operator is warned to be very careful where he churns, for perdition
will issue from most parts of the arani, whereas he who churns
in the right spot will obtain fruition of all his wishes; he will gain
wealth, cattle, sons, heaven, long life, love, and good fortune. Evidently
the tabular part or block of the chark is equivalent to the
wish-rod, and the reason of this is that they are both embodiments
of the lightning."</p>

<p>Doubtless, as has been contended by Dr. Kuhn and many others,
the caduceus or rod of Hermes may be referred to a similar origin;
that it is, in fact, but the Greek development of the original Aryan
myth. The wands of conjurers, the batons of military commanders,
and even the sceptres of monarchs, together with Neptune's trident
and Jove's thundering implement, may without extravagance be
assigned to a similar origin.</p>

<p>The divining rod was made either of hazel, the rowan or mountain
ash, or some other of the European representatives of either the
palasa tree, or the "imperial <i>mimosa</i> of the East." The story of the
origin of these trees, as related in the Veda, is somewhat curious.
It exhibits the root of the superstitious reverence, so common amongst
all the Aryan tribes, in which certain trees and plants are held, and
of the belief in their medical and magical properties. It appears that
the demons had stolen the heavenly soma, or drink of the gods, and
cellared it in some mythical rock or cloud. The falcon (a lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
bird) undertook to restore to the thirsty deities their much prized
liquor. The feathered hero triumphed, but he gained his honours at
the expense of a claw and a plume, of which an arrow from one of
"the enemy" deprived him during his retreat. Both fell to the earth
and took root. From the feather sprung the parna or palasa tree,
which possessed red sap and bore scarlet blossoms. From the claw
a species of thorn was developed. This Dr. Kuhn contends is the
<i>Mimosa catechu</i>, or the "imperial <i>mimosa</i>" referred to. The falcon
being regarded as a lightning-god, the plants and trees sprung from
him were supposed to possess largely the divine attributes of their
progenitor. The Aryan tribes, on migrating into distant lands,
found, of course, that the botanical characteristics of their new homes
differed from those pertaining to that they had left. They, therefore,
selected what, to them, appeared the nearest representatives of
the <i>parna</i> and the <i>mimosa</i>, and endowed them with their supernatural
properties. Amongst the most reverenced in Europe were the fern,
which appears to be but a modern form of the word <i>parna</i>; the
mountain ash, or rowan; the hazel, and the black and white thorn,
and the springwort or St. John's-wort. Kelly says:&mdash;"Among the
many English names of the mountain ash are witchen tree, witch
elm, witch hazel, witch wood; quicken tree, quick beam (<i>quick</i>&mdash;alive,
<i>beam</i>, German <i>baum</i>&mdash;tree); roan tree, roun tree, rowan. These last
three synonyms are from the Norse tongues, and denote, as Grimm
conjectures, the runic or mysterious and magic character of the tree."</p>

<p>Several peculiarities of the mountain ash correspond with others
which characterise the Hindoo palasa. Both bear red berries, and
their leaves are profusely luxuriant. These characteristics are supposed
to correspond to the blood shed by the falcon and the form of
his lost feather. The spikes of the thorn, by a similar process of
reasoning, are identified with the claw detached by the arrow of the
pursuing demon.</p>

<p>The late Bishop Heber, referring to the mimosa of India, relates
facts which clearly identify some of the superstitions of the East
with others in Britain. He appears likewise to have anticipated that
time would disclose their common origin. He says:&mdash;"Near Boitpoor,
in Upper India, I passed a fine tree of the mimosa genus, with
leaves, at a little distance, so much resembling those of the mountain
ash, that I was for a moment deceived, and asked if it did not bring
fruit. They answered no; but that it was a very noble tree, being
called the imperial tree, for its excellent properties; that it slept all
night, and awakened and was alive all day, withdrawing its leaves if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
anyone attempted to touch them. Above all, however, it was useful
as a preservative against magic. A sprig worn in the turban, or suspended
over the bed, was a perfect security against all spells, evil
eye, etc.; inasmuch as the most formidable wizard would not, if he
could help it, approach its shade. One indeed, they said, who was
very renowned for his power, (like Lorinite, in the Kehama,) of killing
plants and drying up their sap with a look, had come to this very tree
and gazed on it intently; but, said the old man, who told me this
with an air of triumph, look as he might, he could do the tree no
harm. I was amazed and surprised to find the superstition which in
England and Scotland attaches to the rowan tree here applied to a
tree of nearly similar form. What nation has in this been the
imitator? <i>Or from what common centre are these common notions
derived?</i>"</p>

<p>M. Du Chaillu, in his second journey to Western Equatorial Africa,
found a similar superstitious reverence for certain trees amongst the
negro inhabitants. He says:&mdash;"At an Ishogo village named Diamba,
which we passed about two o'clock, I saw two heads of the gorilla
(male and female) stuck on two poles placed under the village tree in
the middle of the street. In explanation of this I may mention here
that in almost every Ishogo and Ashango village which I visited there
was a large tree standing about the middle of the main street, and
near the mbuiti or idol-house of the village. The tree is a kind of
Ficus, with large, thick, and glossy leaves. It is planted a sapling
when the village is first built, and is considered to bring good luck to
the inhabitants as a talisman. If the sapling lives, the villagers consider
the omen a good one; but if it dies, they all abandon the place
and found a new village elsewhere. This tree grows rapidly, and
soon forms a conspicuous object, with its broad crown yielding a
pleasant shade in the middle of the street. Fetiches, similar to those
I have described in the account of Rabolo's village, on the Fernand
Vaz, are buried at the foot of the tree; and the gorillas' heads on
poles at Diamba were no doubt placed there as some sort of fetich.
The tree, of course, is held sacred. An additional charm is lent to
these village trees by the great number of little social birds (<i>Sycobius</i>,
three species) which resort to them to build their nests amongst the
foliage. These charming little birds love the society of man as well as
that of their own species. They associate in these trees, sometimes
in incredible quantities, and the noise they make with their chirping,
chatting, and fuss in building their nests and feeding their young is
often greater even than that made by the negroes of the village."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Caledonian Mercury</i>, a very few years ago, published the following
paragraph, which clearly demonstrates that the superstitious reverence
for the mountain ash still exists in a most unmistakable manner in
North Britain:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Superstition in Strathearn.</i>&mdash;It is not many years ago since two
women were seen pulling the tether in a field a few miles from Crieff,
with what object everyone knows. Even more recently a Crieff merchant,
who had adopted the motto 'Pay to-day and trust to-morrow,'
had a piece of rowan tree suspended over his doorway, and after his
death a bit of the same wood was found in each of his pockets as a
preventive against the power of witches. At this moment an honest
farmer in a neighbouring parish has a branch of the rowan tree above
his byres, and it is said that every stranger who enters his gates
passes under this magic wood."</p>

<p>The author of "Sylvan Sketches," (1825), informs us, on the
authority of Lightfoot, that "in the Highlands of Scotland, at the
birth of an infant, the nurse takes a green stick of ash, one end of
which she puts into the fire, and while it is burning receives in a
spoon the sap that oozes from the other, which she administers to the
child as its first food." The infant Zeus, of the Greeks, was first
fed by the Melian nymphs with honey "the fruit of the ash," and with
goat's milk. Kelly says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was a positive, as well as a mythic, reason why the Greeks
should give the ash a name signifying sweetness, because the <i>Fraxinus
ornus</i>, a species of ash indigenous in the south of Europe, yields
manna from its slit bark. They may also have conceived that honey
dropped upon the earth as dew from the heavenly ash, for Theophrastus
mentions a kind of honey which fell in that form from the air, and
which was therefore called <i>aeromelia</i>."</p>

<p>Weber and Dr. Kuhn refer to a passage in one of the sacred books
of the Hindoos, in which an analogous practice is referred to. It
reads, "The father puts his mouth to the right ear of the new-born
babe, and murmurs three times, 'Speech! speech!' Then he gives
it a name, 'Thou art Veda;' that is its secret name. Then he mixes
clotted milk, honey, and butter, and feeds the babe with it out of
pure gold." Referring to this subject, Kelly exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Amazing toughness of popular tradition! Some thousands of
years ago the ancestors of this Highland nurse had known the
<i>Fraxinus ornus</i> in Arya, or on their long journey through Persia,
Asia Minor, and the south of Europe, and they had given its honey-like
juice as divine food to their children; and now their descendant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
imitating their practice in the cold North, but totally ignorant of its
true meaning, puts the nauseous sap of her native ash into the
mouth of her hapless charge, because her mother, and her grandmother,
and her grandmother's mother had done the same thing
before her. 'The reason,' we are told by a modern native authority,
'for giving ash-sap to new-born children in the Highlands of Scotland,
is, first, because it acts as a powerful astringent; and secondly,
because the ash, in common with the rowan, is supposed to possess
the property of resisting the attacks of witches, fairies, and other
imps of darkness.'" Mr. Kelly regards the astringent argument as
evidently not the reason why the practice was first adopted, but an
excuse, and a bad one, for its continuance. In many places mothers
yet pass their infants through split ash trees in the belief that it will
cure them of, or protect them from, the rickets or rupture.</p>

<p>Brand regards the Christian pastoral crook, as well as the "lituus
or staff with the crook at one end, which the augurs of old carried
as badges of their profession, and instruments in the superstitious
exercise of it," as originally intimately connected with the divining rod.
He refers to Hogarth's "Analysis of Beauty," in which the great
satirical artist gives an engraving of what he terms a "<i>lusus natur&aelig;</i>,"
which represents a "very elegant" branch of the ash tree. Brand
seems to endorse Mr. Gostling's opinion, as expressed in the "Antiquarian
Repertory," who says, "I should rather style it a distemper
or distortion of nature; for it seems the effect of a wound by some
insect, which, piercing to the heart of the plant with its proboscis,
poisons that, while the bark remains uninjured and proceeds in its
growth, but formed into various stripes, flatness, and curves, for
want of the support which nature designed it. The beauty some of
these arrive at might well consecrate them to the fopperies of heathenism,
and their rarity occasions imitations of them by art. The pastoral
staff of the Church of Rome seems to have been formed from the
vegetable litui, though the general idea is, I know, that it is an imitation
of the shepherd's crook." Gostling's paper is accompanied by
engravings of "carved branches of the ash." Brand speaks of one of
these curious "freaks of nature," which he saw in the possession of
an old woman at Beeralstown, in Devonshire, as "extremely beautiful."
He was very anxious to purchase it, but the old lady refused
to "part with it on any account, thinking it would be unlucky to do
so."</p>

<p>Several modern writers on comparative mythology class the wish
or divining rod amongst the numerous forms which the stauros, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
phallic emblem, has presented itself. The Rev. G. W. Cox, in his
"Mythology of the Aryan Nations," is very explicit on this point.
He says,&mdash;"The wooden emblem carries us, however, more directly to
the natural mythology of the subject. The rod acquired an inherent
vitality, and put forth leaves and branches in the Thyrsoi of the
Dionysiac worshippers and the Seistron of Egyptian priests. It
became the tree of life, and reappeared as the rod of wealth and
happiness given by Apoll&ocirc;n to Hermes, the mystic spear which Abaris
received from the Hyperborean Sun-god, and which came daily to
Phoibus in his exile laden with all good things. It was seen as the
lituus of the augur, the crooked staff of the shepherd, the sceptre of
the king, and the divining rod which pointed out hidden springs or
treasures to modern conjurors. In a form which adhered still more
strictly to the first idea the emblem became the stauros or cross of
Osiris, and a new source of mythology was thus laid open. To the
Egyptians the cross thus became the symbol of immortality, and the
god himself was crucified to a tree which denoted his fructifying
power.... It is peculiar neither to the Egyptians nor Assyrians,
neither to Greeks, Latins, Gauls, Germans or Hindus." Mr. Cox
includes among its various forms the "trident of Poseidon or Proteus,
and the fylfot or hammer of Thor, which assumes the form of a cross
patt&eacute;e." Increase of wealth by natural fruition evidently lies at the
root of many of the myths which relate to hidden treasures, whether
buried in the interior of mountains or elsewhere, as well as to the
properties of magic purses, festive tables, cornucopi&aelig;, etc.</p>

<p>The following paragraph appeared in the newspapers in March,
1866. It appears, from it, that in the eastern counties the bible has
superseded the "wish-rod" as an instrument of divination:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Novel Use for the Bible.</span>&mdash;At the Norwich assizes, on Wednesday,
the case of Creak <i>v.</i> Smith was tried. It was an action for slander,
the slanderous words imputed to the defendant being as follows:&mdash;'You
are the thief, and no other man. You have robbed the fatherless
and the motherless, and got in at the window. I can prove it by
the turn of the Bible.' One of the witnesses for the plaintiff explained
what was meant by the expression, 'I'll prove it by the turn
of the Bible.' He said that the defendant had told him that a friend
of his, having asked him whether he had ever heard anything about
the Bible being turned, bade him come to his house and he would
show him what it was. That evening, when this person went home,
he told his wife what he had said to defendant, and she went through
the ceremony, which was done by holding a Bible by a string, twisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
it round, and as it was turning calling out the names of all in the
house until she came to the plaintiff's name last of all, when it turned
round the other way, showing that he was the guilty man. This
ceremony was performed by her a second time by the husband's
bedside, with the same triumphant result.&mdash;The jury gave a verdict
for 20s. damages."</p>

<p>Since most of the above was written I have read the following, in Mr.
Robert Hunt's "Drolls, Traditions, and Superstitions of Old Cornwall,"
which seems to throw a doubt upon the antiquity of the divining rod,
<i>at least as far as Cornish mining is concerned</i>. The statement, however,
in no way invalidates the fact that the hazel, ash, and other trees
were held in great veneration from the most remote antiquity either
in Cornwall or elsewhere:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It may appear strange to many that having dealt with the superstitions
of the Cornish people, no mention has been made of the
Divining Rod (<i>the Dowzing Rod</i>, as it is called), and its use in the
discovery of mineral lodes. This has been avoided, in the first place,
because any mention of the practice of '<i>dowzing</i>' would lead to a
discussion, for which this work is not intended; and in the second
place, because the use of the hazel-twig is not Cornish. The
divining or dowzing rod is certainly not older than the German miners,
who were brought over by Queen Elizabeth to teach the Cornish
to work the mines, one of whom, called Schutz, was some time
Warden of the Stannaries. Indeed there is good reason for believing
that the use of this wand is of more recent date, and consequently,
removed from the periods which are sought to be illustrated by this
collection. The divining rod belongs no more to them than do the
modern mysteries of twirling hats, of teaching tables to turn, and&mdash;in
their wooden way&mdash;to talk."</p>

<p>Of course, as Mr. Hunt assigns not the good reason referred
to for his statement, it can but be regarded as the expression of an
individual opinion. It may, perhaps, be <i>locally true</i>, either wholly or
in part. However, whatever may be its value, in such matters it is
incumbent on the earnest seeker after truth to conceal no apparently
incongruous facts or hostile opinions.</p>

<p>The writer of an article on "Stick and Table Turning," published
in "All the Year Round," makes the following comments on the
manner in which this superstition exhibits itself during the present
generation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A good deal of attention was paid by the newspapers to certain
alleged achievements of two diviners, or dowsers, about twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
ago. They were West of England men, named Adams and Mapstone.
A farmer near Wedmore, in Somerset, wishing for a supply of water
on his farm, applied to Mapstone. Mapstone used a hazel rod in the
usual way, and when he came over a particular spot declared that
water would be found fifteen or twenty feet beneath the surface.
Digging was therefore commenced at that spot, and water appeared
at a depth of nineteen feet. The other expert, Adams, who claimed
to have been instrumental in the discovery of nearly a hundred springs
in the West of England, went one day by invitation to the house of
Mr. Phippen, a surgeon, at Wedmore, to dowse for water. He
walked about in the garden behind Mr. Phippen's house until the
stick became so agitated that he could not keep it steady; it bent
down at a spot which he asserted must have clear water underneath
it. Mr. Phippen caused a digging to be made, and water was really
found at the spot indicated. As a means of testing Adams's powers
in relation to metals, three hats were placed in a row in the kitchen,
and three silver spoons under one of the hats. Adams walked among
the hats, and his rod told him which of them covered the treasure.
Then three kinds of valuables, gold, silver, and jewels, were placed
under three hats, one kind under each, and he found out which was
which. On one occasion he dowsed for water in the grounds of the
Rev. Mr. Foster, of Sodbury, in Gloucestershire. Using the same
method as before, he announced the presence of water at a particular
spot, twenty feet beneath the surface. A pamphlet published by Mr.
Phippen concerning these curious facts attracted the attention of Mr.
Marshall, partner in the great flax factory at Leeds. Water was
wanted at the mill, and the owners were willing to see whether dowsing
could effect anything in the matter. Mr. Marshall invited Adams
to come down and search for springs. On one occasion, when blindfolded,
Adams failed, but hit the mark pretty nearly in the second
attempt, excusing himself for the first failure on the ground that 'he
was not used to be blindfolded.' Of the main experiments, Mr.
Marshall afterwards said, in a letter to the newspapers, 'I tested
Adams by taking him over some deep borings at our manufactory,
where he could have no possible guide from anything he could see;
and he certainly pointed out nearly the position of the springs, as
shown by the produce of the bore-holes, some being much more productive
than others. The same was the result at another factory,
where Adams could have had no guide from what he saw, and could
not have got information otherwise.'"</p>

<p>This superstition has been imported into Australia, where it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to flourish with remarkable vigour, notwithstanding the boasted
enlightenment and civilisation of the race and age. The following
paragraph, which appeared in a Melbourne newspaper in the early
part of the year 1867, speaks for itself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the area of Kiora, lying to the southward of Ararat, the settlers,
who are very anxious to discover springs of water upon their selections,
have engaged the services of an old man, apparently between sixty
and seventy years of age, who professes to discover springs by the aid
of a divining rod. He has already pointed out two spots where he
confidently states water will be found at a moderate depth, and the
farmers are now engaged in practically proving his skill. We are
told that the diviner holds a slender strip of steel between the finger
and thumb of both hands, and walks about the land with it in this
position. When water is approached, the rod trembles violently, and
the motion ceases as the place is left. One of the settlers, Mr.
Tomkins, with the view of testing his accuracy, had the diviner
blindfolded (after pointing out the spot where water would be found)
and taken to another portion of his land, but he states that the motion
of the rod led him, with but little hesitation, back to the same place.
The old man refuses to take money for his services till water be
obtained, and when proved to exist asks &pound;3 from each individual.
He states that the rod was owned by his father, and that it will not
indicate water in the hands of any of his brothers. While engaged
at Kiora he showed some of the farmers letters which he had received
from a number of squatters engaging his services on their stations in
a similar capacity; and he left to fulfil these engagements, with a
view of returning for payment when the sinking is concluded. He
professes to name within three feet of the depth at which water will
be obtained, but cannot say if it will prove fresh or salt."</p>

<p>A superstition somewhat akin to that in which the divining rod
plays so prominent a part, still lingers in various parts of the country.
It is believed that a loaf of wheaten bread, containing a quantity of
quicksilver in its centre, will, on being placed in a running stream,
rest over the spot where a drowned body lies. The experiment was
tried very recently, and an account of it appeared in the newspapers.
In this instance, however, the "faithful believers" were grievously
disappointed, as the loaf floated past the spot where the body was
afterwards discovered.</p>

<p>Another form of this superstition is referred to by Dr. Randal
Caldicot, who, evidently, lacked not faith in its efficacy. He says,&mdash;"When
any Christian is drowned in the river Dee, there will appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
over the water where the corpse is, a light, by which means they
do find the body, and it is therefore called the holy Dee."</p>

<p>Aubrey, in his "Miscellanies," quotes a letter addressed to Mr.
Baxter, referring to the Welsh "corpse-candle" superstitions, in
which the writer <i>naively</i> says that the light "doth as much resemble
a material candle-light as eggs do eggs."</p>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> no ancient superstition has had a more enduring existence
than what Mr. Hunt terms "well-worship." This may have arisen,
to some extent, from the fact that water, under certain conditions,
possesses undoubted "medical virtues." The necessity of personal
cleanliness to ensure ordinary comfort, and the value of aqueous
agency in its achievement, would doubtless exercise some influence,
even in remote times. Add to this the horrors of a "water famine,"
the intense suffering resulting from prolonged thirst, and we can well
imagine that the early tribes of men who worshipped fire would
feel a corresponding reverence for what may be termed its
natural complement&mdash;water. The sun's heat was powerless for
good, nay, it was potent for evil, unless in close alliance with the
"gentle rain from heaven." From their union springs the warm
moisture essential to vegetable growth. Water, too, in more modern
times, has been largely employed as a symbol of purity; and, in the
Roman Catholic Church, especially, has been consecrated to religious
purposes, and rendered "holy." It is, indeed, employed by all
Christian sects, in the rite of baptism, as symbolising purity. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
it is not surprising that many springs, and especially in the neighbourhood
of religious houses, should in the middle ages have been invested
with a sacred character, or that superstition of a more ancient and a
heathen origin should yet, as it were, haunt their precincts. On this
subject Mr. Robert Hunt makes the following eloquent and pertinent
observations:&mdash;"The purity of the liquid impresses itself, through
the eye, upon the mind, and its power of removing all impurity is felt
to the soul. 'Wash and be clean,' is the murmuring call of the waters,
as they overflow their rocky basins, or grassy vases, and deeply sunk
in depravity must that man be who could put to unholy uses one of
nature's fountains. The inner life of a well of waters, bursting from
its grave in the earth, may be religiously said to form a type of the
soul purified by death, rising into a glorified existence and the fulness
of light. The tranquil beauty of the rising waters, whispering the
softest music, like the healthful breathing of a sleeping infant, sends
a feeling of happiness through the soul of the thoughtful observer,
and the inner man is purified by its influence, as the outer man
is cleansed by ablution."</p>

<p>Many such wells as those in connection with the "Old Friary," at
Preston, which gave the name to Ladywell-street, in that borough,
like that which performed a similar office for the now notorious
"Hollywell street," near the Strand, in London, have passed away,
and left nothing behind but the street nomenclature referred to.
Others, however, like the St. Mary's well, at the foot of the hill on
which the old priory of Penwortham was situated, yet retain, in many
minds, not only their reputation for the medical value of their waters,
but a vague remnant of reverence and even superstition is still to a
large extent associated with them.</p>

<p>A spring in the parish of Brindle, near Preston, has some traditionary
associations in connection with it which I am inclined to
think date back far into pagan antiquity, notwithstanding the fact
that it has been for centuries named "St. Helen's well." The name
has become corrupted by the neighbouring peasantry in a most singular
manner. On my first visit to the locality, I inquired of an
elderly woman if she could inform me in what direction I should proceed
to find <i>St. Helen's well</i>. She at first said she had never heard
of such a place, but after considerable hesitation she at length exclaimed
with some animation, in the dialect of the district, "Oh! it
ull be Stelling well yo mean, I'll be bun." A writer under the signature,
"Leicestriensis," in vol. 6, p. 152, of "Notes and Queries,"
speaking of a St. Austin's well, near Leicester says:&mdash;"On making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
some inquiries, a few years ago, of the 'oldest inhabitant' of the
neighbourhood, respecting <i>St. Augustine's well</i>, he at first pleaded
ignorance of it, but at length, suddenly enlightened, exclaimed, 'Oh!
you mean Tosting's well.'" Cakes baked for the lace-makers' feasts
in Buckinghamshire, in honour of St. Andrew, their patron saint, are
locally termed "Tandry Cakes." These are both curious and instructive
specimens of the manner in which names of places and persons
undergo changes in their transmission from generation to generation
by popular tradition.</p>

<p>St. Helen's well, which is now sadly neglected, is situated about a
mile and a half to the south-west of the village of Brindle. Dr.
Kuerden, who resided in the neighbourhood, thus refers to it, about
two centuries ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Over against Swansey House, a little towards the hill, standeth
an ancient fabric, once the manor house of Brindle, where hath been
a chappel belonging to the same, and, a little above it, a spring of
very clear water rushing straight upwards into the midst of a fayre
fountain, walled square about in stone and flagged in the bottom,
very transparent to be seen, and a strong stream issuing out of the
same. The fountain is called Saint Ellen's Well, to which place the
vulgar neighbouring people of the Red letter do much resort, with
pretended devotion, on each year upon St. Ellen's day, where and
when out of a foolish ceremony they offer or throw into the well pins,
which there being left may be seen a long time after by any visitor to
that fountain."</p>

<p>There is a St. Helen's well, near Sefton, in West Lancashire, into
which pins were formerly thrown by the credulous, as at Brindle.</p>

<p>The superstitions connected with this "pin dropping" into certain
wells are somewhat varied in character. They, however, seem to
have generally some relation to divination or fortune-telling, and
appear to have found their chief patrons in the fair sex. The well
superstitions of this class are widely spread. Dudley Costello tells us
that in many parts of Brittany they keep a very watchful eye over the
morals of the young women. The fountain of Bobdilis, near Landividian,
is famous as an ordeal to test propriety of conduct. The pin
which fastens the habit shirt is dropped into the water, and if it touch
the bottom with the point downwards the girl is freed from all suspicion;
if, on the contrary, it turns the other way and sinks head
foremost, her reputation is irretrievably damaged.</p>

<p>The author of "Wanderings in Brittany" informs us that there is
a "magic well" of this class at or near Barenton, to which peasants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
yet bring their children when ill of fever, having faith in the healing
powers of the water. He thus describes the manner in which the
deity of the spring is invoked:&mdash;"You say 'Ris! Ris! Fontaine de
Barenton,' dropping a pin the while into the spring, whereupon it
breaks into ripples and bubbles; if it laughs you are to be fortunate; if
it remains mute you will be unlucky. Tradition and poetry both say
the water fizzes around a sword point, but we had nothing larger
than pins to try it with, and to these it responded gaily." He adds
that "when the country was in great want of rain, a procession
was formed to the fountain, and the priest dipped the foot of the cross,
out of the church, into the water, after which rain is sure to fall abundantly.
This ceremony has been successful very lately." The same
writer refers to another superstition, in connection with the "magic
well," which plainly indicates its pagan origin. He says:&mdash;"The
peasants believe the priests can punish them by sprinkling water from
the spring on the large stone, the <i>Perron of Merlin</i>, above the well,
which brings rain throughout the whole parish for many days."</p>

<p>"Seleucus," in "Notes and Queries," speaks of a well, with a superstition
connected with it similar to the one at Brindle, in the Welsh
peninsula of Gower. It is called the "Cefyn Bryn or the Holy Well."
He says, "it is still supposed to be under the especial patronage of
the Virgin Mary, and a crooked pin is the offering of every visitor to
its sacred precincts. It is believed that if this pin be dropped in with
fervent faith, all the many pins which have ever been thrown into it
may be seen rising from the bottom to greet the new one. Argue the
impossibility of the thing, and you are told, it is true it never happens
<i>now</i>, such earnestness of faith being, 'alas!' extinct."</p>

<p>In the same work, vol. 6, p. 28, Robert Rawlinson speaks of a spring
near Wooler, in Northumberland, locally known as "<i>Pin Well</i>." He
says "the country maids, in passing this spring, drop a crooked pin
into the water. In Westmorland there is also a <i>pin well</i>, into the
water of which rich and poor drop a pin in passing. The superstition
in both cases consists in the belief that the well is under the charge
of a fairy, and that it is necessary to propitiate the little lady by a present
of some sort: hence the pin, as most convenient. The crooked
pin of Northumberland may be explained upon the received hypothesis
in folk-lore, that crooked things are lucky things, as a 'crooked sixpence,'
&amp;c."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt, in his chapter on the "Superstitions of the Wells," gives
numerous examples of its prevalence in the remote West of England.
The water in the well of St. Ludvan formerly miraculously enlarged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the sense of sight, and loosened the tongue of the true believer; but
a demon that the good saint, after a terrible struggle, exorcised from
out the body of a child and laid in the Red Sea, in his rage, "by
spitting in the water," destroyed its efficacy in these matters. But
it is believed still that any child baptised in its waters is certain never
to succumb to the genius of Calcraft, and his hempen instrument of
death. "On a cord of silk," however, we are informed that "it is
stated to have no power." Some years back, notwithstanding, a
woman was actually hanged here for the murder of her husband,
whom she had poisoned with arsenic in order to clear the way
for a more favoured lover. As she was born near the magic well,
and was supposed to have been baptised with its waters, the greatest
consternation prevailed in the neighbourhood. The much prized
fountain had lost its cherished virtue! What was to be done
under such a lamentable state of things? The necks of the inhabitants
would in future be in equal jeopardy with those of the
rest of her Majesty's subjects! It was, however, by some indefatigable
enquirer, at last discovered that a mistake had been made;
the murderer had not been born in the parish, and consequently had
not been baptised with the liquid which flowed from the well of St.
Ludwin. Great was the joy of the inhabitants on the receipt of this
welcome news. The spring not only recovered its ancient prestige,
but became more famous than ever.</p>

<p>The Gulvell Well, in Fosses Moor, answered the demands of lone
married women or love-sick spinsters respecting their absent husbands
or sweethearts. Mr. Hunt relates how a mother, one Jane Thomas,
with her babe in her arms, recently, after a severe mental struggle,
obeyed the injunction of an old hag, a "sort of guardian of the well,"
and tested its efficacy. "She knelt on the mat of bright green grass
which grew around, and leaning over the well so as to see her child's
face in the water, she repeated after her instructor,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Water, water, tell me truly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the man I love duly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the earth or under sod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick or well&mdash;in the name of God!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Some minutes passed in perfect silence, and anxiety was rapidly
turning cheeks and lips pale, when the colour rapidly returned. There
was a gush of clear water from below, bubble rapidly followed bubble,
sparkling brightly in the morning sunshine. Full of joy the young
mother rose from her knees and exclaimed, 'I am happy now.'" It
appears that if the party inquired after should be sick, the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
bubbles, but in a filthy, muddy, condition. If he should be dead, it
remains perfectly quiescent, to the dismay of the person seeking
information.</p>

<p>There is a singular superstition attached to the well of St. Keyne,
"namely, that whichever of a newly-married couple should first drink
thereof was to enjoy the sweetness of domestic sovereignty ever after."
Referring to this superstition, Mr. Hunt says:&mdash;"Once, and once
only, have I paid a visit to this sacred spot. Then and there I found
a lady drinking of the waters from her thimble, and eagerly contending
with her husband that the right to rule was hers. The man, however,
mildly insisted upon it that he had the first drink, as he had
rushed before his wife, and, dipping his fingers into the waters, had
sucked them. This, the lady contended, was not drinking, and she,
no doubt, through life had the best of the argument."</p>

<p>There is one well in Cornwall which has long had a reputation for
the cure of insanity. Carew, in his "Survey," describes the formula
adopted to ensure a successful result:&mdash;"The water running from
St. Nun's well fell into a square and enclosed walled plat, which
might be filled at what depth they listed. Upon this wall was the
frantic person put to stand, his back towards the pool, and from
thence, with a sudden blow in the breast, tumbled headlong into the
pond; where a strong fellow, provided for the nonce, took him and
tossed him up and down, alongst and athwart the water, till the
patient by foregoing his strength had somewhat forgot his fury.
Then was he conveyed to the church, and certain masses said over
him; upon which handling, if his right wits returned, St. Nun had
the thanks; but if there appeared small amendment, he was bowssened
again and again, while there remained in him any hope of life
or recovery."</p>

<p>A well on the line of the Roman Wall, near Walltown, in Northumberland,
has two distinct traditions attached to it and its neighbourhood!
It is locally termed the "King's Well," or "King Arthur's
Well." Hutchison says:&mdash;"Travellers are shown a well among the
cliffs, where it is said Paulinus baptised King Egbert; but it is more
probable it was Edwin, king of Northumberland." Dr. Collingwood
Bruce says:&mdash;"The well has no doubt been a place of historical interest
and importance, but unhappily modern drainage is robbing it
of its treasures. Another interesting circumstance is connected with
this locality. In the crevices of the whin-rock near the house chives
grow abundantly. The general opinion is that we are indebted for
these plants to the Romans, who were much addicted to the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
these and kindred vegetables. Most of the early writers refer to this
subject; let the reader take a passage from Camden:&mdash;'The fabulous
tales of the common people concerning this Wall, I doe wittingly and
wilfully overpasse. Yet this one thing which I was enformed of by men
of good credit, I will not conceale from the reader. There continueth
a settled perswasion among a great part of the people there about,
and the same received by tradition, that the Roman soldiers of the
marches did plant here every where in old time for their use certain
medicinable herbs, for to cure wounds; whence it is that some emperic
practitioners of chirurgery in Scotland, flock here every year in the
beginning of summer, to gather such simples and wound-herbes; the
vertue whereof they highly commend as found by long experience,
and to be of singular efficacy.'"</p>

<p>Many wells have been famous for the cure of "rickety" children.
The mothers generally plunged them <i>three times into the water</i>, as they
drew them three times through the cleft rowan or ash tree, with a
similar object. In my youth I remember being solemnly informed,
on bathing for the first time at the cold bath below the Maudlands,
on Preston Marsh, that three distinct plunges into the fearfully cold
liquid was the orthodox number, especially if medical benefit was the
object sought.</p>

<p>The "Maddern or Madron Well, in Cornwall," and another, appear
to be the only wells in that district that, like the one in Brindle, properly
come under the designation of "<i>pin wells</i>." The curative properties of
the former were held in very high repute. Bishop Hale, of Exeter,
relates, in his "Great Mystery of Godliness," a singular anecdote respecting
its presumed miraculous power. Referring to the case of a
well-known cripple, he says, "This man, for sixteen years, was forced
to walke upon his hands, by reason of the sinews of his leggs were soe
contracted that he cold not goe or walke on his feet, who upon monition
in a dream to wash in that well, which accordingly he did, was
suddenly restored to the use of his limbs; and I sawe him both able
to walk and gett his own maintenance. I found here was neither art
nor collusion&mdash;the cure done, author our invisible God," etc.</p>

<p>In a MS., dated 1777, formerly in the library of Thomas Artle,
Esq., and published by Davis Gilbert, F.R.S., in his "Parochial
History of Cornwall," there is some curious information respecting
this class of superstitions, which throws some light on the practices,
formerly of ordinary occurrence, at St. Helen's Well, Brindle. The
writer says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Madron Well&mdash;and, I have no doubt, in many others&mdash;may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
be found frequently the pins which have been dropped by maidens
desirous of knowing 'when they were to be married.' I once witnessed
the whole ceremony performed by a group of beautiful girls, who had
walked on a May morning from Penzance. Two pieces of straw,
about an inch long each, were crossed and the pin run through them.
This cross was then dropped into the water, and the rising bubbles
carefully counted, as they marked the number of years which would
pass ere the arrival of the happy day. This practice also prevailed
amongst the visitors to the well at the foot of Monacuddle Grove,
near St. Austell. On approaching the waters, each visitor is expected
to throw in a crooked pin; and, if you are lucky, you may possibly
see the other pins rising from the bottom to meet the most recent
offering. Rags and votive offerings to the genius of the waters are
hung around many of the wells."</p>

<p>We have accounts of similar customs in North Britain and in the
Hebrides. J. F. Campbell, in his "Popular Tales of the West Highlands,"
says:&mdash;"Holy healing wells are common all over the Highlands,
and people still leave offerings of pins and nails, and bits of
rag, though few would confess it. There is a well in Islay, where I
myself have, after drinking, deposited copper caps amongst a hoard
of pins and buttons, and similar gear, placed in chinks in the rocks
and trees at the edge of the 'Witches Well.' There is another well
with similar offerings freshly placed beside it, in an island in Loch
Meree, in Ross-shire, and many similar wells are to be found in other
places in Scotland."</p>

<p>A spring in connection with the ancient abbey at Glastonbury retained
its reputation for sanctity and medical virtue until a very recent period.
In consequence of some astounding, or, indeed, miraculous cure supposed
to have been effected by its agency, immense numbers of
invalids flocked to it in the years 1750 and 1751. It is said that, in
the month of May, in the latter year, ten thousand persons visited
Glastonbury, under the influence of this superstition.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, the following paragraph, from the
<i>Banffshire Journal</i>, has come under my notice. It demonstrates the
retention to the present day not only of the ancient superstition respecting
wells, but likewise of some others to which I have referred
in previous chapters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Modern Scotch Witch.</span>&mdash;On the 23rd of February, there
died at Mill of Ribrae, parish of Forglen, Margaret Grant, at the
advanced age of 69 years; and as she represented a class which is
regarded as becoming very few in number in the present day, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
or three remarks on the chief features of her character may not be
unacceptable. Margaret was superstitious, and fully and firmly
believed, up to her dying day, that she possessed power to remove or
avert the ills and aliments of both man and beast, especially of the
latter; and this by means of various incantations, ceremonies, and
appliances&mdash;such as fresh cuttings of 'ra'n tree,' some of which she
always carried about with her. She would carefully place so many
before and so many behind the particular beast she meant to benefit.
Another potent charm was what she called 'holy water,' taken, no
doubt, from some 'old and fabulous well.' This she also generally
carried along with her, and used partly in sprinkling the pathway of
the individuals she designed to bless&mdash;the rest to be mixed in common
water to wash the hands and face. In the case of such as she was
desirous should prosper, and be defended from evil, she would go
round and round their dwellings, carrying along a rod of her wonder-working
'ra'n tree'&mdash;and this was usually done at a very early hour
in the morning. She also believed herself to be transmutable, and
that she was at times actually changed by evil-disposed persons into
a pony or hare, and rode for great distances, or was hunted by dogs,
as the case might be. We have heard of several other strange enchantments
which Margaret practised when she had opportunity, and
was allowed. But in all her foibles there was ever conspicuous the
design of doing good."</p>

<p>From this it would appear that Margaret Grant was a witch of the
white kind, they having, as I have previously shown, power only for
good. The black were potent only for evil, and the grey ones were a
combination of the other two.</p>

<p>I have previously referred to the "well-dressings," or the decoration
of springs and fountains, yet very common in some counties, and
especially in Derbyshire, and suggested that they owe their origin to
the Roman Floralia, or to a still older custom, the common Aryan
root of both. Crofton Croker speaks of the existence of "well
worship" in Ireland; Dr. O'Conner, in his "Travels in Persia,"
notices its prevalence in the East; and Sir William Betham, in his
"Gael and Cymbri," says, "The Celt&aelig; were much addicted to the
worship of fountains and rivers as divinities." He adds, "They had
a deity called Divona, or the river-god." It seems, therefore, very
clear that this superstition, in one form or another, is not only widely
disseminated, but that its origin may, with safety, be ascribed to a
very remote period in the history of humanity.</p>

<p>The deification of rivers and streams appears to have very generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
prevailed amongst the ancients. Young and beautiful women, under
the general name of Naiads, in the Greek and Roman mythologies,
were believed to preside over brooks, springs, and rivers. Many of
the heroic personages described by the early Greek poets are said to
be the offspring of nymphs of this class.</p>

<p>Each river was supposed to be under the protection of its presiding
deity. Their sources were especially sacred, and religious ceremonies
were performed in their immediate vicinity. As at the Clitumnus,
so beautifully described by Byron, in "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage,"
temples were erected near the fountains which gave them birth, and
small pieces of money were frequently thrown into their crystal
streams with the view to the propitiation of the presiding deities.
Sacrifices were offered to them, and no bather was allowed to lave
his limbs near the source of any consecrated stream, because the contact
of the naked body was held to pollute the water. Sir John
Lubbock, in his dissertation on the lacustrine dwellings which have
recently been discovered in Alpine districts of Europe, as well as in
some other localities, has the following pertinent observations on this
subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It has been suggested that the early inhabitants of Switzerland
may have worshipped the Lakes, and that the beautiful bracelets,
etc., may have been offerings to the gods. In fact, it appears from
ancient writers that among the Gauls, Germans, and other nations,
many lakes were regarded as sacred. M. Aymard has collected
several instances of this kind. According to Cicero, Justin, and
Strabo, there was a lake near Toulouse in which the neighbouring
tribes used to deposit offerings of gold and silver. Tacitus, Virgil,
and Pliny also mention the existence of sacred lakes. Again, so
late as the sixth century, Gregory of Tours, who is quoted by M.
Troyon and M. Aymard, tells us that on Mount Helanus there was a
lake which was the object of popular worship. Every year the inhabitants
of the neighbourhood brought to it offerings of clothes,
skins, cheeses, cakes, etc. Traces of a similar superstition may still
be found lingering in remote parts of Scotland and Ireland; in the
former country I have myself seen a sacred spring surrounded by the
offerings of the neighbouring peasantry, who seemed to consider pence
and half-pence as the most appropriate and agreeable sacrifice to the
spirit of the waters."</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Inverness Courier</i> states, as recently as last
year (1871), that he had recently witnessed a strange instance of the
existence of this superstition, "at a loch in the district of Strathnaver,
county of Sutherland." The editor says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dipping in the loch for the purpose of effecting extraordinary
cures is stated to be a matter of periodical occurrence, and the 14th
appears to have been selected as immediately after the beginning of
August in the old style. The hour was between midnight and one
o'clock, and the scene, as described by our correspondent, was absurd
and disgraceful beyond belief, though not without a touch of weird
interest, imparted by the darkness of the night and the superstitious
faith of the people. 'The impotent, the halt, the lunatic, and the
tender infant were all waiting about midnight for an immersion in
Lochmanur. The night was calm, the stars countless, and meteors
were occasionally shooting about in all quarters of the heavens above.
A streaky white belt could be observed in the remotest part of the
firmament. Yet with all this the night was dark&mdash;so dark that one
could not recognise friend or foe but by close contact and speech.
About fifty persons, all told, were present near one spot, and I believe
other parts of the loch side were similarly occupied, but I cannot
vouch for this&mdash;only I heard voices which would lead me so to infer.
About twelve stripped and walked into the loch, performing their
ablutions three times. Those who were not able to act for themselves
were assisted, some of them being led willingly and others by
force, for there were cases of each kind. One young woman, strictly
guarded, was an object of great pity. She raved in a distressing
manner, repeating religions phrases, some of which were very earnest
and pathetic. She prayed her guardians not to immerse her, saying
that it was not a communion occasion, and asking if they could call
this righteousness or faithfulness, or if they could compare the loch
and its virtues to the right arm of Christ. These utterances were
enough to move any person hearing them. Poor girl! what possible
good could immersion do to her? I would have more faith in a
shower-bath applied pretty freely and often to the head. No male,
so far as I could see, denuded himself for a plunge. Whether this
was owing to hesitation regarding the virtues of the water, or whether
any of the men were ailing, I could not ascertain. These gatherings
take place twice a year, and are known far and near to such as put
belief in the spell. But the climax of absurdity is in paying the loch
in sterling coin. Forsooth, the cure cannot be effected without money
cast into the waters! I may add that the practice of dipping in the
loch is said to have been carried on from time immemorial, and it is
alleged that many cures have been effected by it.'"</p>

<p>Some pools, streams, or lakes, such as Acheron and Avernus, were
associated with the infernal regions, or the nether world, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
mythical inhabitants. The mother of the monster Grendel, slain by
the Anglo-Saxon hero, Beowulf, according to the ancient poem, dwelt
in the recesses of a bottomless pool, beneath the dark shadow of a
dense wood in the neighbourhood of Hartlepool, on the coast of
Durham. The Scottish Kelpie is a kind of "mischievous water
spirit said to haunt fords and ferries at night, <i>especially in storms</i>."</p>

<p>Burns says in his "Address to the Deil":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When thowes dissolve the snawy hoord,<br /></span>

<p>In the same poem Burns refers to the devil himself as an aquatic
spirit. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>Commenting on this poem, Allan Cunningham relates a characteristic
anecdote. He says,&mdash;"The Prince and Power of the air is a
favourite topic of rustic speculation. An old shepherd told me he
had, when a boy, as good as seen him. 'I was,' said he, 'returning
from school, and I stopped till the twilight groping trouts in a <i>burn,
when a thunder storm came on</i>. I looked up, and just before me a
<i>cloud</i> came down as dark as night&mdash;the <i>queerest-shaped cloud</i> I ever
saw; and there was something terrible about it, for when it was close
to me, I saw as plain as I see you, a dark form within it, thrice the
size of any earthly man. It was the Evil One himself, there's nae
doubt o' that. 'Samuel,' I said, 'did you hear his <i>cloven foot</i> on the
ground?' 'No,' replied he, 'but I saw one of his <i>horns</i>&mdash;and O,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
what waves o' fire were rowing after him!' The Devil frequently
makes his appearance in our old mysteries, but he comes to
work unmitigated mischief, and we part with him gladly. The
'<i>Hornie</i>,' 'Satan,' 'Nick,' or 'Clootie,' who lives in the imaginations
of the peasantry, is not quite such a reprobate, though his shape is
anything but prepossessing. Nor is he an object of much alarm;
a knowledge of the scriptures and a belief in heaven are considered
sure protectors; and a peasant will brave a suspicious road at midnight
if he can repeat a psalm."</p>

<p>The <i>horn</i> and the <i>cloven foot</i> in such intimate connection with the
descent over the burn of a mysterious dark cloud accompanied by
waves of fire, is suggestive of the Aryan thunder and rain clouds and
of their attendant lightning-god. The peasant's faith in the efficacy of
a psalm in overcoming the evil influence is rather corroborative of this,
as the superstitious fear for the dethroned gods of the old mythology
long survived the introduction of Christianity in the country. It is
yet firmly believed in Lancashire that, after going through some
mysterious magic formula, and repeating the Lord's prayer <i>backwards</i>,
that his Satanic majesty will appear in the centre of a circle previously
defined. In my youth, "raising the devil," was not considered
by the knowing ones to be a particularly arduous task; the
getting rid of him, afterwards, was the great difficulty. Some contended
that the recital of a certain psalm or other passage from the
scriptures was alone efficacious. Others held that holy water was
his especial abhorrence, and that the repetition of the Lord's prayer,
in its proper order, was essential to success.</p>

<p>I remember well, when very young, being cautioned against approaching
to the side of stagnant pools of water partially covered with
vegetation. At the time, I firmly believed that, if I disobeyed this
instruction, a certain water "boggart" named "Jenny Greenteeth"
would drag me beneath her verdant screen and subject me to other
tortures besides death by drowning. This superstition is yet very
common in Lancashire.</p>

<p>In "Brother Fabian's Manuscript" there is a description of a
water-sprite, which appears to be one of the many singular forms
which the memory of the dethroned &AElig;sir god, Wodin or Odin, has
assumed in the popular imagination:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where, by the marishes, bloometh the bittern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nickar, the soulless one, sits with his ghittern;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits inconsolable, friendless and foeless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting his destiny, Nickar the soulless.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>Sir Noel Paton, R.S.A., has recently exhibited a picture of this
mythic sprite, treated with great &aelig;sthetic power and poetic sympathy.
The colour, the light and shade, the surrounding accessories, as
well as the quaint melancholy features of the "doomed one," and
his still quainter frog-like feet, all combine to leave a single harmonious
emotional impression. This is further enhanced by the
presence of the partially obscured moon and the solitary star, as
well as the sedges and other plants, which, with the lonely bittern,
(now extinct in Britain) affect marshy places; and by the Batrachian
reptile which crawls from the water towards the feet of the "fallen
god," who, whilst patiently awaiting his destiny, lulls his senses to
sleep with the music of his ghittern, a singularly old-fashioned instrument
apparently allied to the modern guitar. This myth is evidently
one form of the popular superstition which connected natural phenomena
of a peculiar character with the memory of Nickarr (old Nick),
or the dethroned Odin of our Teutonic ancestors. Nickarr, it has
previously been shown, was one of the appellations pertaining to this
deity.</p>

<p>The Scotch Kelpies were supposed to be delighted with the last
agonies of drowning men and of mariners in distress. Thomas
Landseer, in the notes which accompany his admirable illustrations
of Burns's poem, says:&mdash;"It is not twenty years since the piercing
shrieks and supplications for help, of a passage boat's company, which
had been landed on a sandbank at low water, in the Solway Firth,
instead of on the Cumberland coast, and who found, as the moon rose
and the haze dispersed, that they were in mid-channel, with a strong
tide setting fast in upon them, were mistaken by the people, both on
the Scotch and English shores, for the wailings of Kelpies! The
consequence was that the unhappy people (whose boat had drifted
from them before their fatal error was discovered) were drowned;
though nothing had been easier, but for the rooted superstition of
their neighbours ashore, than to have effectually succoured them."</p>

<p>The same writer makes the following sensible observations respecting
the superstitions referred to by Burns. The poet, however,
evidently attributed the phenomena to natural causes:&mdash;"This propensity
to attribute natural effects to supernatural causes is one of
the best known and least intelligible phenomena of the human mind.
We are always rejecting the evidence of our senses, to tamper with
the imaginary evidence supplied by analogous reasoning upon mere
abstract principles. The good wife never dreamed of referring her
alarms to the natural objects around her. A humming drone, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
twilight by the waters, a rustling in the leaves of the trees about her
cottage&mdash;if these did not bespeak the presence of the devil, what the
d&mdash;&mdash;l else could they indicate? Thus our poet proceeds to tell us
that beyond the same loch, he himself had a visible encounter with
something <span class="smcapl">LIKE</span>, indeed, to a <i>bunch of rushes</i>, waving and shaking in the
wind; and after an admirable description of the emotions of fear, by
which he was oppressed, he incidentally mentions that the Great
Unknown did certainly, with an abrupt and hasty flight, take away
like a drake; but even the appropriate note of the fluttering fowl
never once awakened his suspicion that it might be the fowl proper
and not the foul fiend!"</p>

<p>M. Du Chaillu, in his "Journey to Ashango-land," relates a singular
legend, believed in by the natives of Aviia, respecting a series
of rapids and a singularly picturesque waterfall which he discovered
on the river Ngouyai, and which bears some resemblance to the
popular legend about Wayland Smith and to those already referred
to. He says:&mdash;"Like all other remarkable natural objects, the falls of
the Ngouyai, have given rise, in the fertile imaginations of the negroes,
to mythical stories. The legend runs that the main falls are the
work of the spirit Fougamou, who resides there, and who was <i>in old
times</i> a mighty forger of iron; but the rapids above are presided over
by Nagoshi, the wife of Samba, who has spoiled this part of the river
in order to prevent people from ascending and descending. The falls
to which the name Samba is given lie a good day's journey below the
Fougamou, but, from the description of the natives, I concluded they
were only rapids like the Nagoshi above. The Fougamou is the only
great fall of water. It takes its name from the spirit (mbuiri) who
is said to have made it, and who watches it constantly, wandering
night and day round the falls. A legend on this subject was related
to us with great animation by our Aviia guide, to the following effect:
In former times people used to go to the falls, deposit iron and charcoal
on the river side and say, 'Oh! mighty Fougamou, I want this
iron to be worked into a knife or hatchet,' (or whatever implement it
might be), and, in the morning, when they went to the place, they
found the weapon finished. One day, however, a man and his son
went with their iron and charcoal, and had the impertinent curiosity
to wait and see how it was done. They hid themselves,&mdash;the father,
in the hollow of a tree, and the son, amongst the boughs of another
tree. Fougamou came with his son and began to work, when suddenly
the son said, 'Father, I smell the smell of people!' The
father replied, 'Of course you smell people, for does not the iron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
charcoal come from the hands of people?' So they worked on. But
the son again interrupted his father, repeating the same words, and
then Fougamou looked round and saw the two men. He roared with
rage, and, to punish the father and son, he turned the tree in which
the father was hidden into an ant-hill, and the hiding place of the
son into a nest of black ants. Since then Fougamou has not worked
iron for the people any more."</p>

<p>In another place, Du Chaillu says,&mdash;"I was much amused by the
story one of the men related about the dry and wet seasons. The remarkable
dryness of the present season had been talked over a good
deal, and it was this conversation which led to the story. As usual
with the African, the two seasons were personified, <i>Nchanga</i>, being
the name of the wet, and <i>Enomo</i> that of the dry season. One day,
the story went, Nchanga and Enomo had a great dispute as to which
was the older, and they came at last to lay a wager on the question,
which was to be decided in an assembly of the people of the air or
sky. Nchanga said, 'When I come to a place rain comes.' Enomo
retorted, 'When I make my appearance the rains goes.' The people
of the air all listened, and, when the two disputants had ceased,
they exclaimed, 'Verily, verily, we cannot tell which is the eldest,
you must be both of the same age.'"</p>

<p class="mt2 noin"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding chapters the chief object I have had in view has
been to show that many superstitions and legends yet, or recently,
familiar to the people of our northern counties, were, like their
congeners in other portions of Europe, descendants from one
common parentage. I have dealt almost entirely with that species
of folk-lore which I think has been originally communicated <i>orally</i>
from one generation to another, and not so much with that which
may be termed the <i>literary</i> fictions of Europe and the East, except
in so far as there is good reason to know that the latter are
built upon the former. Still Oriental scholars assure us that "many
of our best European fictions, as well single stories as whole collections,
may be traced from Europe to Arabia, and from Arabia
to India, and that the <i>Indian</i> form of the story or collection <i>almost
invariably bears the marks of an earlier origin than any other form</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
appears to be, if not the original form, at least the oldest surviving
one."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless many other traditionary observances, now nearly obsolete,
might be traced to a similar origin to that which I have ascribed to
those treated of in this work. Sufficient, however, I believe, has
been done to demonstrate the fact that many of them are of much
greater antiquity than has generally been supposed. A national
religion may be changed in a relatively short period of time, but
superstition and tradition, in some form or other, hold their own
amongst the populace for ages after their original significance has
perished.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Hallam, referring to the religious condition of the
Britons at the time of the heptarchy, says "the retention of
heathen superstitions was not incompatible, in that age, with a
cordial faith" in Christianity.</p>

<p>The late war in Mexico has afforded a striking modern instance of
the truth of this proposition. The Christianity of the native Mexican
Indians, according to a writer in the <i>Pall Mull Gazette</i> (July, 1867),
"is of a very crude and undeveloped kind, and indeed it is very
doubtful whether in some parts of the country it has ever really
eradicated the old religion. <i>But it is quite certain that it has not eradicated
the old superstitions.</i> Just as many Pagan feasts in Southern
Italy have been converted into Christian feasts by mere change of
name, so has the Christianity of the Mexicans been grafted on to their
old belief and superstitions, and although they may not quite have
believed that the arrival of the Emperor Maximilian was really the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
fulfilment of the long promised second advent of their ancient god
Quetzalcoatle, yet he nevertheless had a white face and a yellow
beard, and came from the West in a ship, and was of an illustrious
descent, and there is no doubt of the fact that the Mexican Indians
received him with open arms, and with a more or less superstitious
veneration, looking to him for the regeneration of their country and
for a release from the dominion of the Spanish creoles."</p>

<p>The Maories, like several branches of the Aryan race, deified,
during life, some of their own warriors. "Watches and white men
also were at first regarded as deities; the latter," says Sir John
Lubbock, "not perhaps unnaturally, as being armed with thunder
and lightning." The Dyaks of Sar&aacute;wak regard the late Sir James
Brooke as a species of deity. After explaining the conditions under
which they lived previous to his advent amongst them, and the vast
amelioration in the conditions of their existence attendant upon his
rule, Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, in his "Malay Archipelago," says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the unknown stranger who had done all this for them, and
asked for nothing in return, what could he be? How was it possible
for them to realise his motives? Was it not natural that they should
refuse to believe he was a man? for of pure benevolence combined
with great power, they had had no experience amongst men. They
naturally concluded that he was a superior being, come down upon
earth to confer blessings upon the afflicted. In many villages where
he had not been seen, I was asked strange questions about him.
Was he not as old as the mountains? Could he not bring the dead
to life? And they firmly believe that he can give them good harvests,
and make their fruit trees bear an abundant crop."</p>

<p>Historians are now pretty generally satisfied, from the combined
evidences of philology, ethnology, and tradition, that the bulk of the
European nations had a common origin in the East, and that some
Asiatic tribes are descendent from the same original stock. I am not,
however, insensible to the value of the fact that the early action and
thought of all tribes or nations present a certain amount of resemblance,
on account of the similar conditions to which each has been
subjected. The aborigines of Australia, the South Sea Islands, and
America, procured fire by means of an instrument similar to the
"chark" of the modern Hindoos and their Aryan ancestors, but they
did not give it the same name. The modern Jews, of Semitic origin,
sacrifice the common fowl on the eve of the Feast of the Atonement.
The belief in the mystical character of chanticleer is equally shared by
the Lancashire and Cornish peasant, the Norseman, the Welshman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the ancient Roman, the modern Hindoo, and some of the North-African
tribes. Mr. Lapham, in describing the "Animal Mounds" of
Wisconsin, speaks of one carved into the shape of a great serpent,
in Adams County. He says,&mdash;"Conforming to the curve of the hill,
and occupying its very summit, is the serpent, its head resting near
the point, and its body winding back for seven hundred feet, in
graceful undulations, terminating in a triple coil at the tail. The
entire length, if extended, would be not less than one thousand
feet.... The outline of the work is clearly and boldly defined....
The neck of the serpent is stretched out, and slightly
curved, and its mouth is opened wide, as if in the act of swallowing
or ejecting an oval figure, which rests partially within the distended
jaws. This oval is formed by an embankment of earth, without any
perceptible opening, four feet in height, and is perfectly regular in
outline, its transverse and conjugate diameters being one hundred
and sixty, and eighty feet, respectively." This looks, certainly, very
like the gigantic Scotch serpent mound, referred to at page <a href="#Page_51">51</a> of this
work, and the huge worm hills of Durham and the North of England.
Sir John Lubbock has treated this branch of the subject
exhaustively in his recent work on "The Origin of Civilization and
the Primitive Condition of Man."</p>

<p>The Arabs and other Semitic tribes worshipped the sun as well as
the Aryans. The sun and fire worship, likewise, was found to obtain
in more than one state on the discovery of South America. Many
writers have arrived at the conclusion that "there was communication
between the Old World and America in very remote times."
Mr. Baldwin (Pre-historic Nations, p. 393) contends that "the
antiquities of Mexico and Central America reveal religious symbols,
devices, and ideas nearly identical with those found in all countries of
the Old World where Cushite communities formerly existed. They show
us planet worship with its usual orphic and phallic accompaniments.
Humboldt, having travelled in America, and observed remains of these
civilisations, was convinced that such communications formerly
existed. He found evidence of it in the religious symbols, the architecture,
the hieroglyphics, and the social customs made manifest by the
ruins, which he was sure came from the other side of the ocean; and,
in his view, the date of this communication was older than 'the present
division of Asia into Chinese, Mongols, Hindus,' etc. Humboldt did
not observe symbols of phallic worship, but the Abb&eacute; Brasseur de
Bourbourg shows that they were described by Spanish writers at the
time of the Conquest. He points out that they were prevalent in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
countries of Mexico and Central America, being very abundant at
Colhuacan, on the Gulf of California, and at Panuco. Colhuacan was
a flourishing city, and the capital of an important kingdom; 'there,'
he says, 'phallic institutions had existed from time immemorial.' At
Panuco phallic symbols abounded in the temples and on the public
monuments. These, with the serpent devices, the sun worship, and
the remarkable knowledge of astronomy that existed in connection
with them, show a system of religion of which the Abb&eacute; is constrained
to say: 'Asia appears to have been the cradle of this religion, and of
the social institutions which it consecrated.'" The ancient traditions
preserved by the inhabitants seem to countenance this view. They
speak of a race of "bearded white men who came across the ocean
from the East."</p>

<p>A writer in a recent number of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> has the
following pertinent remarks on this curious and interesting subject:&mdash;"One
fact corroborative of the idea that the Old World, or at least
some of the inhabitants of Asia, were once aware of the existence
of America before its discovery by Columbus, is that many of the
Arabian ulema with whom I have conversed on this subject are fully
convinced that the ancient Arabian geographers knew of America;
and, in support of this opinion, point to passages in old works in
which a country to the west of the Atlantic is spoken of. An Arab
gentleman, a friend of mine, General Hussein Pasha, in a work he
has just written on America, called 'En-Nesser-Et Tayir,' quotes
from Djeldeki and other old writers to show this."</p>

<p>This writer favours the view that the Chinese, at a very remote
period, became acquainted with the American continent, <i>via</i> the Pacific
Ocean. Some writers regard the inscription on the celebrated Dighton
rock, on the east bank of the Taunton river, as Ph&#339;nician. This,
however, has been disputed. Others regard it as commemorative of
an Indian triumph at some remote period.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles Frederick Winslow, in his recently published work,
"Force and Nature," expresses himself strongly in favour of the
truth of the presumed ancient communication between the Asian
and the American continents. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In order to sustain this position, I might, were it admissible,
adduce here, as collateral proof, an important and hitherto unpublished
fact, of an arch&aelig;ological character, in addition to my
geographical and geological observations made upon the coasts and
islands of the Pacific Ocean. The fact is this, brought to my knowledge
by an unusually extensive practice of my profession, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
uniform custom of <i>dorsocision</i> has existed throughout the Polynesian
islands from periods unknown, and beyond all tradition, embracing
alike New Zealand, Esther Island, Tahiti, the Marquesas, and
Hawaii&mdash;a rite wholly different from, but similar in its results to, the
Jewish one of circumcision; and that this has been performed at
the eighth or ninth year in all of them, and transmitted by father to
son, with undeviating precision, from generation to generation. A
fact of this character so deeply rooted in the moral, social, and traditional
life of many peoples thus widely distributed throughout that
vast ocean, so remotely separated from each other, and without intercourse,
indicates even more strongly than colour, caste or language,
not only the unity of their progenitors, but also the wide-spread
existence of a single race, the vestiges of which were left here and
there above the waters when the land sank between America and
Asia, and received the older seas into a new basin."</p>

<p>Various hypotheses have been suggested as to the direction in
which the flora of the "Old World," and especially of the <i>miocene</i>
division of the tertiary formations, migrated to America, or <i>vice versa</i>.
Heer, the celebrated Swiss naturalist, favours the Atlantic route, and
regards certain important relations between the fauna of the continents
of Europe and America as corroborative, to some extent, at
least, of the truth of the statement of the Egyptian priests to Plato,
that there, at one time, existed a continent named Atlantis, in the
midst of the space now occupied by the Atlantic ocean. Sir Charles
Lyell, however, on geological grounds, dissents from this view, and
rather inclines to the one propounded by Dr. Asa Gray and Mr. Bentham,
that the route of the migration was in the opposite or Pacific
direction, "and took a course four times as long across America and
the whole of Asia." Lyell says,&mdash;"It is the enormous depth and
width of the Atlantic which makes us shrink from the hypothesis of
a migration of plants, fitted for a sub-tropical climate in the Upper
Miocene period, from America to Europe, by a direct course from
west to east. Can we not escape from this difficulty by adopting the
theory that the forms of vegetation common to recent America and
Miocene Europe, first extended from east to west across North
America and passed thence by Behring's Straits and the Aleutian
Islands to Kamtschatka, and thence by land, placed between the 40th
and 60th parallels of latitude where the Kurile Islands and Japan are
now situated, and thence to China, from which they made their way
across Asia to Europe?"</p>

<p>Mr. Consul Plowden, in a report to the Earl of Clarendon, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
years ago, mentions some Abyssinian superstitions which much
resemble others of Aryan origin. Although the Abyssinians are said
to be descended from the Semitic<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> branch of the human family, it
must not be forgotten that Christianity has prevailed amongst them
from a very early period; and, consequently, sympathetic intercourse
must have taken place in the less remote past between them and some
of the offshoots of the Aryan stock. Mr. Plowden says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Abyssinians are superstitious; they believe in the efficacy of
amulets; of writings in jargon mixed with Scripture; in the charms of
Mussulmans to control the hail and the rain; in spirits of the forest
and the river; in omens; in fortune-tellers; and in devils that may
be cast out by spells from their human victims, quoting the authority
of the New Testament for their belief&mdash;to these they attribute epilepsy
and other incurable diseases. One absurdity has, however, led to the
death of many innocent individuals; all workers in iron, and some
others, are supposed to convert themselves into hyenas, and to prey
invisibly on their enemies, and many have been slaughtered in this
belief. This singular idea, which is universal and tenacious, has its
parallel in the 'loup-garou' of France and the 'wehr-wolf' of
Germany."</p>

<p>Speaking of the natives of Minahasa, the north-east promontory of
the island Celebes, in the Malayan Archipelago, Mr. Russel Wallace,
after commending their modern qualities, refers to their original condition
when first discovered by Europeans. He says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Their religion was that naturally engendered in the undeveloped
human mind by the contemplation of grand natural phenomena and
the luxuriance of tropical nature. The burning mountain, the torrent
and the lake, were the abode of their deities; and certain trees and
birds were supposed to have especial influence over men's actions and
destiny. They held wild and exciting festivals to propitiate these
deities or demons; and believed that men could be changed by them
into animals, either during life or after death."</p>

<p>These superstitions would themselves suggest some remote connection
with India; and, singularly enough, Mr. Wallace, in his map
of the Malay Archipelago, just includes them within the boundary
line which divides the Hindoo-Malayan from the Austro-Malayan
region of this district. Indeed, as has been before observed, he shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
that in the neighbouring island of Bali, the religion of the Brahmins
still obtains, and that magnificent ruins of their temples still exist in
the island of Java. Therefore it is not improbable some of these now
reclaimed savages may be only degenerate descendants from the
original Hindoo-Aryan stock.</p>

<p>There is doubtless much force in Hallam's observation that "similarity
of laws and customs <i>may often</i> be traced to natural causes in
the state of society rather than to imitation." Yet the strong
tendency of all humanity to imitation of every kind, the "toughness
of tradition," and the longevity of superstitious belief, are nevertheless
equally powerful agents in the mental development of humanity,
and demand the most careful consideration and regard, when the
nature and character of progressive civilisation, in any age or
country, is subjected to philosophical analysis.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the preceding chapters, that many traditions and
superstitions appear insensibly to glide into each other. Sometimes
two or more seem, as it were, to overlie one another, or to have
become indeed even more intimately compounded. With regard to
superstitions, this is very apparent in those which relate to witchcraft,
were-wolves, transformations, the furious host, the spectre huntsman,
giants, heroes, tyrant lords, etc. This is parallelled by many traditionary
beliefs both general and local. In whatever part of the country stands
a ruined castle or abbey or other religious establishment, the nearest
peasant or even farmer, will assure an enquirer that it was battered into
ruin by Oliver Cromwell! Here the secretary Cromwell, of Henry the
Eighth's reign, and the renowned Protector of the following century
are evidently amalgamated. Indeed the redoubted Oliver himself seems
to have absorbed all the castle-destroying heroes of the national history,
Old Time included. The Arthur legends appear to have been constructed
upon a somewhat similar principle. At the "pass of the
Ribble," near Preston, the site of Cromwell's victory over the Duke
of Hamilton, every human skull which is dug up or washed by the
swollen river from out of its banks, is believed to pertain to a "Scotch
warrior" who fell in that battle. Scottish armies have crossed the
pass on several occasions from the days of Athelstan to those of the
"Young Pretender," but tradition has fused them nearly all into one.</p>

<p>The sites of ruined churches, abbeys, etc., are believed yet to
entomb the ancient edifices, and superstitious people say that, by
applying the ear to the earth at midnight, on Christmas eve, they
can hear the bells ringing. It is not unlikely, when this practice
was a common one, that the sound of some distant bells might occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
be feebly conducted by the earth, and give countenance to
this very universal superstition. The strength of this species of
traditionary faith was forcibly illustrated, a few years ago, at the
"Maudlands," Preston. Historical records and discovered remains,
as well as tradition, marked the locality as the site of a Medi&aelig;val
Hospital, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen. A "square mound,"
evidently an artificial earthwork, was a conspicuous object. Learned
antiquaries regarded this as of Roman construction, although no
actual remains had been discovered to attest the truth of the conjecture.
Popular superstition, however, declared that the mound resulted
from the pressure of the steeple of the church of the Hospital,
which was entombed beneath it, and that the truth of this could be
attested on any Christmas-Eve by the experiment referred to.
Doubts being entertained as to the Roman character of the work,
some local antiquaries caused excavations to be made in the mound.
So prevalent was this superstition, that, on the discovery of a small
brick chamber, scores of people eagerly visited the spot, and retired
fully convinced they had seen a portion of the steeple of the sunken
edifice, and that its discovery demonstrated the truth of the ancient
tradition! Singularly enough, in this instance, "antiquarianism"
and "folk-lore" proved equally at fault. Remains of pottery, bulbous
shaped tobacco pipe bowls, called by the populace both "fairy pipes"
and "Cromwell pipes," etc., together with documentary and other
evidence, enabled me, in my "History of Preston and its Environs,"
to demonstrate that the mound in question was the most modern
structure then on the ground; that it formed part of the defences of
Preston constructed by Colonel Rosworm, after the capture of the town
by the Parliamentary troops under Sir John Seaton, in 1643; and that
the small brick chamber, in all probability, was the remains of a
powder and "match" magazine. However satisfactory this appears
to intelligent historical students and general readers, still the sunken
church and the Christmas-Eve bell-ringing yet finds favour with some
not otherwise ignorant persons. A precisely similar legend is implicitly
believed by many in connection with the Roman outwork on
Mellor Hill, on the line of ancient road from Manchester to Ribchester.</p>

<p>Ancient castles and monasteries were supposed to have underground
means of intercommunication. One tradition of this class,
near Preston, presents some remarkable features. In my youth I
and the public generally firmly believed that some such work as
the celebrated "Thames tunnel" had, ages ago, been constructed
beneath the bed of the Ribble and its broad valley, to enable the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
monks at Tulketh to communicate with the inmates of the priory
on the opposite table land at Penwortham. In the "History of
Preston and its Environs," I have endeavoured to sift out the little
truth that may underlie this strange tradition. Finding good evidence
that each of these promontories had been occupied as outposts
or <i>specul&aelig;</i> in connection with the Roman station at the "Pass of
the Ribble," previously referred to, I have suggested that it is not
improbable the results of the rude system of telegraphy then in
use would be sufficient to utterly confound the ignorant peasantry
of the day, who would be unable to account for the rapid communication
of intelligence except by means of a secret underground passage.
The monks from Evesham, on the establishment of their "cell" at
Penwortham, might, from policy, countenance the tradition of their
predecessors, especially in troubled times, on account of the impression
of power which such a belief would naturally engender amongst the
more ignorant of the population. This way of accounting for the transmission
of secret information and even war material is by no means an
uncommon one amongst uneducated people in various parts of the world.
In Abyssinia, according to Mansfield Parkyns, the people firmly believe
that the German missionaries had "in the course of only a few
days, perforated a tunnel all the way (from Adowa) to Massowa, on
the coast of the Red Sea, a distance of above a hundred and fifty
miles, whence they were to obtain large supplies of arms, ammunition,
etc."</p>

<p>In the churchyard at Ribchester the remains of a Roman temple
dedicated to Minerva have been discovered. Long before this, however,
a singular tradition was current respecting it. Leland, King
Henry the Eighth's antiquary, after visiting the spot, says:&mdash;"Ther
is a place wher the people fable that the <i>Jues</i> had a Temple."
Doubtless the edifice discovered in the early part of the present century
was the temple referred to. In the middle period of Christianity in
England, the only old, or indeed, different religion to their own,
known to the mass of the people, would be the Jewish. Hence the
confounding of the Pagan Romans with their Israelitish successors.</p>

<p>The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (Feb. 1868) contained the following paragraph,
which affords a marked modern illustration of this tendency to the
confusion of various traditions in the popular mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Samson Mohammedan.</span>&mdash;At Miss Heraud's reading of 'Samson
Agonistes,' the Rev. Henry Allon, who presided, mentioned a fact
illustrative of the way in which tradition deals with ancient legends.
As he stood on the site of the Temple of Gaza, two learned Mussulmans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
assured Mr. Allon that Samson was not a Jew but a Mussulman,
and that he pulled down the temple, not on the head of the Philistines,
but on that of the assembled Christians who had persecuted the
Mohammedans."</p>

<p>I have before observed that the European languages referred to are
<i>not asserted to have sprang from the Sanscrit</i>, but that all, on the contrary,
have a common source. The Vedic hymns, however, are the oldest
preserved specimens of any of these cognate tongues.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Considerable
change must have taken place in the southern Aryan speech before
the period when they were written; yet they retain to a great extent,
reliable evidence of the common origin of the languages referred to.
Max M&uuml;ller is very explicit on this subject. He says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Even in the Veda, where <i>dyu</i> occurs as a masculine, as an active
noun, and discloses the same germs of thought which in Greece and
Rome grew into the name of the supreme god of the firmament, Dyu,
the deity, the lord of heaven, the ancient god of light, never assumes
any powerful mythological vitality, never rises to the rank of a supreme
deity. In the earlier lists of Vedic deities, Dyu is not included, and
the real representative of Jupiter in the Veda is not Dyu, but Indra,
a name of Indian growth, and unknown in any other independent
branch of Aryan language. <i>Indra</i> was another conception of the
bright sunny sky, but, partly because its etymological meaning was
obscured, partly through the more active poetry and worship of certain
Rishis, this name gained a complete ascendancy over that of
Dyu, and nearly extinguished the memory in India of one of the
earliest, if not <i>the</i> earliest, name by which the Aryans endeavoured
to express their first conception of the deity. Originally, however,
and this is one of the most important discoveries which we owe to
the study of the Veda&mdash;originally <i>Dyu</i> was the bright heavenly deity
in India as well as in Greece."</p>

<p>The early mythology of the Aryans, and doubtless of all other
savage nations, was more or less a species of, perhaps unconscious, anthropomorphism
or a personification of the powers or forces of nature.
This is beautifully illustrated by a superstition yet existent among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the Ojibbeway Indians in North America. North-west of Fort Garry
lies the lake Manitobah, which has recently given its name to the new
province formed out of the Red River region. This name is derived
from the circumstance that a "mysterious voice" is said to be
occasionally heard at night in a small island in its midst. The
Indians never approach it, believing it to be the home of the
Manitobah, or the "Speaking God." The "voice" is said to result,
as in the case of Charybdis, from the beating of the waves upon the
rocks and shingle of the shore. One writer says:&mdash;"Along the
northern coast of the island there is a long low cliff of fine grained
compact limestone, which, under the stroke of the hammer, clinks
like steel. The waves beating on the shore at the foot of the cliff
cause the fallen fragments to rub against each other, and to give out
a sound resembling the chimes of distant church bells. This phenomenon
occurs when the gale blows from the north, and then, as the
winds subside, low, wailing sounds, like whispering voices, are heard
in the air. Travellers assert that the effect is very impressive, and
they have been awakened at night under the impression that they
were listening to church bells."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The kind of personification referred to would, in the case of prim&aelig;val
man, have certainly but a very remote affinity to that conscious
artistic personification employed by the cultivated poets and
sculptors of after ages. Mr. G. W. Cox, in his "Mythology of the
Aryan Nations," presents this distinction in very forcible language.
He says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The sun would awaken both mornful and inspiriting ideas, ideas
of victory and defeat, of toil and premature death. He would be the
Titan, strangling the serpents of the night before he drove his chariot
up the sky; and he would also be the being who, worn down by
unwilling labour undergone for men, sinks wearied into the arms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the mother who bore him in the morning. Other images would not be
wanting; the dawn and the dew and the violet clouds would not be
less real and living than the sun. In his rising from the east he
would quit the fair dawn, whom he should see no more till his labour
drew towards its close. And not less would he love and be loved by
the dew and by the morning herself, while to both his life would be
fatal as his fiery car rose higher in the sky. So would man speak of
all other things also; of the thunder and the earthquake and the
storm, not less than of summer and of winter. But it would be no
personification, and still less would it be an allegory or metaphor. It
would be to him a <i>veritable reality</i>, which he examined and analysed
as little as he reflected on himself. It would be a sentiment and a
belief, but in no sense a religion."</p>

<p>In other words, prim&aelig;val savages did not work artistically, but
simply observed, thought, and expressed themselves in the only
manner in which they were able.</p>

<p>Kelly describes the usual course of a myth as "beginning in a
figurative explanation of meteoric facts, it next became a hieratic
mystery, and then descended from the domain of religion to that of
magic and popular story."</p>

<p>I have previously observed that the word "Edda," the title of the
work which records the wild mythical cosmogony of the Scandinavian
race, (a mixture of oriental and northern legend), means "Mother of
Poetry." Language itself is largely made up of figures of speech, or
as Jean Paul Richter says it is a "dictionary of faded metaphors,"
the original meaning of which is fully understood but by the philologist.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the unknown should, under
certain conditions, be figuratively described by means of the known,
or that personifications of this class eventuated in the belief in
absolute personal existences, in the minds of doubtless well-meaning,
but, nevertheless, ignorant men. A few verses from H. H. Wilson's
translation of the Vedic hymns will show the nature of this personification:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dyaus (Sky) father, and Prithivi (Earth) kind mother,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Agni
(Fire) brother, ye Vasus (Bright ones) have mercy on us."</p>

<div class="ctr">&middot;<span class="ml4">&middot;</span><span class="ml4">&middot;</span><span class="ml4">&middot;</span><span class="ml4">&middot;</span></div>

<p>"How long is it that the dawns have risen? How long will they
rise?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those mortals who beheld the pristine Ushas dawning have
passed away: to us she is now visible, and they approach who will
behold her in after times.</p>

<p>"Ushas, endowed with truth, who art the sister of Bhava, the
sister of Varuna, be thou hymned first of the gods.</p>

<p>"Unimpeding divine rites, although wearing away the ages of mankind,
the dawn shines the likeness of the mornings that have passed,
or that are to be for ever, the first of those that are to come.</p>

<p>"She shines upon us like a young wife, rousing every living being
to go to his work. The fire had to be kindled by men: she brought
light by striking down darkness.</p>

<p>"She rose up, spreading far and wide, and moving towards every
one she grew in brightness, wearing her brilliant garment. The
mother of the cows, the leader of the dogs, she shone gold-coloured,
lovely to behold.</p>

<p>"She, the fortunate, who brings the eye of the god, who leads the
white and lovely steed (of the sun), the Dawn was seen revealed by
her rays, with brilliant treasures she follows every one.</p>

<p>"Thou, who art a blessing when thou art near, drive far away the
unfriendly; make the pastures wide, give us safety. Remove the
haters, bring treasures, liaise up wealth to the worshipper, thou
mighty Dawn.</p>

<p>"Shine for us with thy best rays, thou bright Dawn, thou who
lengthenest our life, thou the love of all, who givest us wealth in cows,
horses, and chariots."</p></div>

<p>Max M&uuml;ller thus further illustrates the process of the transition
referred to:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To us it is clear that the story of Zeus descending as a golden
rain into the prison of Dana&ecirc; was meant for the bright sky delivering
the earth from the bonds of winter, and awaking in her a new life by
the golden showers of spring. Many of the stories that are told
about the love of Zeus for human and half human heroines have a
similar origin.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The idea which we express by the phrase, 'King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
by the grace of God,' was expressed in ancient language by calling
Kings the descendants of Zeus. This simple and natural conception
gave rise to innumerable local legends. Great families and whole
tribes claimed Zeus for their ancestor; and as it was necessary in
each case to supply him with a wife, the name of the country was
naturally chosen to supply the wanting link in these sacred genealogies.
Thus <i>&AElig;acus</i> the famous king of <i>&AElig;gina</i>, was fabled to be the offspring
of Zeus. This need not have meant more than that he was a
powerful, wise, and just king. But it soon came to mean more.
&AElig;acus was fabled to have been really the son of Zeus, and Zeus is
represented as carrying off &AElig;gina and making her the mother of
&AElig;acus.... It is said that Zeus in the form of a bull carried
off <i>Europ&acirc;</i>. This means no more if we translate it back into Sanscrit,
than that the strong rising sun (Vrishan) carries off the wide-shining
dawn. This story is alluded to again and again in the Veda. Now
<i>Minos</i>, the ancient King of Crete, required parents; so Zeus and
Europ&acirc; were assigned to him."</p>

<p>The fabled ravishment of Leda by Jupiter in the form of a swan is
capable of a like interpretation. Light clouds were called swans,
and Mr. Cox regards a white mist, in this instance, to form an
equivalent to the golden shower of the Dana&ecirc; legend.</p>

<p>In like manner the myth which fabled that &#338;dipus married his
mother after murdering his father, is divested of its revolting features.
It is held to imply no more than that the sun destroys the darkness
and sinks at evening into the twilight from whence he sprung.</p>

<p>Max M&uuml;ller, in his "History of Sanscrit Literature," points out
that similar meanings clearly underlie the Vedic myths. He says:</p>

<p>"It is fabled that Praj&acirc;pati, the Lord of Creation, did violence to
his daughter. But what does it mean? Praj&acirc;pati, the Lord of
Creation, is the name of the sun; and he is called so because he
protects all creatures. His daughter Ushas is the dawn. And when
it is said that he was in love with her, this only means that, at
sunrise, the sun runs after the dawn, the dawn being at the same
time called the daughter of the sun, because she rises when he
approaches. In the same manner it was said that Indra was the
seducer of Ahaly&acirc;, this does not imply that the god Indra committed
such a crime; but Indra means the sun, and Ahaly&acirc; the night;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and as the night is seduced and ruined by the sun of the morning,
therefore is Indra called the paramour of Ahaly&acirc;."</p>

<p>This throws a new and satisfactory light upon what has long been
regarded as a serious blot upon the morals of the ancient Greeks, as
exhibited by the conduct of the most exalted of the deities which
figure in their picturesque and poetic, but certainly not very decorous,
mythological theogony.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin, in his lecture on "Light," delivered at Oxford recently,
gives several excellent examples of Greek personifications of this
class. He concludes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then join with these the Northern legends connected with the
air. It does not matter whether you take Dorus as the son of Apollo
or the son of Helen; he equally symbolises the power of light; while
his brother &AElig;olus, through all his descendants, chiefly in Sisyphus,
is confused or associated with the real god of the winds, and represents
to you the power of the air. And then, as this conception
enters into art, you have the myths of D&aelig;dalus, the flight of Icarus,
and the story of Phrixus and Helle, giving you continual associations
of the physical air and light, ending with the power of Athena over
Corinth as well as over Athens. Now, once having the clue, you can
work out the sequels for yourselves better than I can for you; and
you will soon find even the earliest or slightest grotesques of Greek
art become full of interest to you. For nothing is more wonderful
than the depth of meaning which nations in their first days of thought,
like children, can attach to the rudest symbols; and what to us is
grotesque or ugly, like a little child's doll, can speak to them the
loveliest things."</p>

<p>We have already seen, in Chapter X., that Lord Bacon regarded
the great mass of the Greek myths as allegories. Another ingenious
mode of interpreting the artistically beautiful mythology of the
Greeks is eloquently expressed by Wordsworth, in his poem, "The
Excursion":&mdash;</p>

<p>This figurative or poetical element in the classical mythology would,
doubtless, be understood by the more cultured sections of the ancient
populations of the later period, at least to a certain extent. For
instance; Ovid distinctly states that under the name Vesta direct
reference is made to fire. Socrates, too, understood nothing more
than the north wind in the name Boreas. I have previously referred
to the statement of Diodorus Siculus, that although the mythographers
spoke of Prometheus stealing fire from heaven, they merely
intended to imply that he was the inventor of the "chark," or fire-producing
instrument. Some, if not all, of the earlier Greek writers,
however, including Homer and Hesiod, appear, like the mass of the
populace, to have treated their mythic personages as actual concrete
beings.</p>

<p>Farrer, in his "Origin of Language," forcibly illustrates the figurative
character of much of our ordinary every-day speech. He says,&mdash;"The
continual metaphors by which we compare our thoughts and
emotions to the changes of the outer world&mdash;sadness to a cloudy sky,
calm to the silvery rays of the moonlight, anger to waves agitated by
the wind&mdash;are not, as Schelling observed, a mere play of the imagination,
but are an expression, in two different languages, of the same
thought of the Creator, and one serves to interpret the other. 'Nature
is visible spirit, spirit invisible nature.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Shakspere is supposed to have founded some portions of his Tempest
on a narrative of the shipwreck of Sir John Somers on one of
the Bermuda islands. These islands were then uninhabited by man,
and generally believed to be "enchanted." Old Stowe, in his
"Annals," speaking of this shipwreck, among other things, says
these islands "were, of all nations, said and supposed to be enchanted
and inhabited with witches and devills, which grow by reason of
accustomed monstrous thunder, storms, and tempests." One of
Shakspere's commentators, referring to this passage, says,&mdash;"This
account by old Stowe of the elemental growth and generation of the
hags and imps and devils and abortions of the island, is fearfully fine.
Caliban and Sycorax and Setebos, might well be imagined to have
first glared into life through the long fermenting incantation of
'accustomed monstrous thunder.'" Ruskin says "the whole play of
the Tempest is an allegorical representation of the powers of true,
and, therefore, spiritual, liberty, as opposed to true, and, therefore,
carnal and brutal, slavery. There is not a sentence nor a rhyme
sung or uttered by Ariel or Caliban throughout the play which has
not this under meaning."</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer has truly said, "We too often forget that not only
is there 'a soul of goodness in things evil,' but very generally also,
a soul of truth in things erroneous."</p>

<p>Thus, these despised and contemned traditionary superstitions of
our progenitors are found, nevertheless, to enshrine much valuable
material, by a careful study of which we may obtain a deeper insight
into some of the more subtle or hidden features of the human soul,
the nature and progress of man's intellectual growth, of the origin
and development of language as a medium of mental intercommunion,
and of the true natural basis on which rest some of the greatest
triumphs of plastic and poetic art that have astonished, delighted,
and instructed mankind for countless generations.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Penny Cyclop., article Syntipas.&mdash;Syntipas is the "title of a collection of stories
written in Greek, and bearing the name of Michael Andreopulos, but the collection
is evidently translated from an Oriental work.... Many of the stories of Syntipas
are found in an Arabic manuscript of the 'Arabian Nights,' in the British Museum.
The whole style of the stories points evidently to an Indian origin. The same may
be said of the collection named Pancha Tantra, the original of the Fables of Pilpay,
and some other Indian stories."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Sir John Lubbock, in his "Pre-historic Times," says,&mdash;"Nor will tradition
supply the place of history. At best it is untrustworthy and short-lived. Thus in
1770 the New Zealanders had no recollection of Tasman's visit. Yet this took place
in 1643, less than 130 years before, and must have been to them an event of the
greatest possible importance and interest. In the same way the North American
Indians soon lost all tradition of De Soto's expedition, although 'by its striking
incidents it was so well suited to impress the Indian mind.'" This is no doubt true
in relation to many matters which leave behind no religious or superstitious element.
When this, however, is superadded, tradition becomes, as Dasent expresses it, remarkable
for its toughness, or enduring vitality. Other authorities say, however, that
on Cook's arrival, the tradition of Tasman's visit was preserved amongst the natives
of the Tonga or Friendly Islands.</p></div>

M. Lejean, of a spoken language between Kashmir and Afghanistan containing
older idioms than Sanscrit, and nearer in affinity to the cognate European
tongues. At a recent meeting of the Philological Society, Professor Goldst&uuml;cker
mentioned, as a curious fact, that, in old Sanscrit musical manuscripts, the word <i>laya</i>
occurs with the same meaning as in French and English. The word <i>laya</i> has not yet
found its way into any Sanscrit glossary.</p></div>

placed large whelk or other univalve shells to the ear, and, after listening with

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
